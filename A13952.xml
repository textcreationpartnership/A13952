            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot long ſince (Courteous Reader,) a friend of mine commending this Booke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, vpon the generall good liking conceyved thereof in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall by the learned, intreated mee for the further good of the Church, to take vpon me the Tranſlation therof: Which, though at firſt, I was vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe, eſpecially for that in the peruſall thereof, I found it ſo Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, as that it required much Art, Reading, &amp; Leaſure of him that ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:3172:5"/> performe that buſineſse. Yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Booke for matter is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for Art exquiſite, and for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode more compendious then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I haue read in this kind, I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured the imployment of that Art, Reading, and Leyſure which I haue, in the Tranſlation of the ſame. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as my labour hath beene the more difficult, partly, becauſe the Treatiſe is Logicall, and therefore in many places are required proper and fitte tearmes of Art, wherein our Engliſh tongue is penurious; partly, becauſe of many Greeke words very ſignifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not eaſily expreſsed word for word in our language; partly alſo by reaſon of ſome few faultes committed in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Printing, (from which no Booke can bee free,) and therefore had but my coniecture at the correction thereof; ſo I truſt it ſhall bee the more
<pb facs="tcp:3172:5"/> favourably cenſured, if ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be found Defectiue. Concerning my dealing herein, I haue followed the Author as neerely in ſence, as my Iudgement apprehended, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in Wordes as Diſcretion guided me, and as fitly in Phraſe, as the Idiome of our Tongue could ſuffer. Onely I haue inſerted here and there a Worde of mine owne, eyther for the explayning of Wordes more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, or for the ſupplying of ſuch, as in Latine are more tollerably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode: All which, I haue for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſake noted with a Parentheſis. And withall, for the better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Intelligent, haue placed all the obſcure Latine Wordes in the Margent, as leaving them to their choyce, eyther to accept of mine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as it is, or allow of their own, if it be better. As for the places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:3172:6"/> quoted in the Margent, I leaue them as I found them. It remayneth therefore (Chriſtian Reader) that thou take in good part, what I offer in good will.

In ſo great a plenty of ſo many Theologicall Bookes, and common Places, the Students of Divinity haue of long time complayned of ſcarſity, and that not without cauſe; for the Writers and Authors of common Places, (who are in vſe amongſt young Students,) doe eyther with their prolixitie delay the speedy, longer then is meet, or with their overmuch brevity, eyther compell them to runne backe the ſame way of doctrine too often with loathing, or barre them from the other,
<pb facs="tcp:3172:8"/> (which is by way of reprooving) with danger. Hence it is, that the fervour of Study waxeth faint, and before it be liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oftentimes waxeth old. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long ago both my deſire, and the deſire of all that are ſtudious in ſacred Theology, that both parts of Divinity might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and brought into a compendious Breviary by a Scholaſticall, and Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcourſe: which, wile I wiſhed, and waited for from others, who abound both in leyſure and Learning, it ſeemed good vnto <hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">i</hi>
               </hi> me to publiſh this our Booke, as a witneſſe of our common deſire, that as a fore-runner it might invite, and provoke thoſe great wittes, whereof this age is most fruitefull, to accompliſh the ſame. Which if I ſhall obtayne, I verily profeſſe, that I haue receyved a plentifull fruit of this my labour: the meane while I truſt, if as I would request, that thoſe things, whereof I am ignorant, might bee imparted vnto me, without concealing of arrrogancy; ſo it ſhall be likewiſe acceptable, that I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thoſe few things which I know, vnto them that are deſirous thereof. Moreover,
<pb facs="tcp:3172:9"/> whereas the profeſſion of the handling of common places was committed vnto mee, and the explication of them, was now at length to be taken in hand againe: I thought good, not onely to eaſe my Auditors from a trouble of writing, but alſo to lay forth, as in a Table, to their memory, and eyes, what hereafter they ought to expect from me, &amp; haue withall, as a guide in the way, with the finger pointed at the matter, to ſhew vnto the ſtudious, the way, (and that the readieſt way) to the Doctrinall, and reprooving Knowledge of Theologie. Now, vnto you (Right Honourable) I offer, and conſecrate of due right, and deſert, theſe first fruites of my profeſſion, ſuch as they are, as the young tender ſeedes of my The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall Harvest, which firſt ſprung vp in your field, and afterwardes, through your courteous favour, attayned vnto ſome maturity; both, that I may testifie and ſhew ſome proofe of my thankefull heart, by this taske of duety, and eſpecially, that yee may the more ſtirre vp your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving favours and my studies, and ſo yeelde your ſelues to be my forwarders, and ſtout
<pb facs="tcp:3172:9"/> protectors againſt the barking mouthes of the malevolent. And ſo I hope, and truſt in the Lord you will: vnto whome I pray (Right Honourable,) that he will proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the courſe of all your Councels, and very long preſerue you in a ſafe and flouriſhing Eſtate for the good of this Vniverſity and Common-wealth.

               <hi>Common Experience,</hi> for even the Gentiles themſelues being ſtrangers from God, had the Oracles of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in ſtead of theſe from God rather then that they would deny that ſtamped Divininity, or bee ſaide to want the ſame<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1.21.22.23.</note>, for hence it came to paſſe, that whereas among the Heathen, ſome of their Gods were thought to bee very Gods, ſome others to be ſuch ſpirites, as they called <hi>Daemones,</hi> the heathens Divinity was held to bee of two partes, for the one treated of the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the other of<note n="d" place="margin">Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> thoſe ſpirites, which they called <hi>Daemones,</hi> that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3172:14"/> treated of their Gods,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Civit. Dei, cap. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> was held of them to bee three-ſold, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> out of <hi>Varro</hi> teacheth, to wit, <hi>Poeticall, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> and <hi>Civill,</hi> that which did ſet forth the power of thoſe ſpirites, was two-fold: for whereas of thoſe ſpirites, called <hi>Doemones,</hi> ſome were good, ſome evill: that which diſcourſed of the evill ſpirites who were to bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and appeaſed, was called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke and Inchantment: but the other which delighted the good with ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was called Divine miniſtration and Expiation: therefore there is a Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Now if you reſpect the true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word, it is defined thus, to bee a knowledge of the Oracles or ſpeeches of God: but if the thing or matter it ſelfe; it is a true wiſedome of divine thinges from God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, eyther by meane Naturall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to inbred principles, or elſe by a meane more excellent, according to grace ſupernaturall.</p>
            <p>And of this <hi>Divinity</hi> wee ſpeake in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3172:14"/> this place, wee call it <hi>Wiſedome</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Scripture:<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 26.</note> firſt, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the thing, as being the moſt certaine declarer of principles, &amp; moſt noble Princeſſe of all ſciences: ſecondly, for the ſingular meane or manner of knowing, for this wiſedome is diſtinguiſhed from that which in the Scripture is called earthly, ſenſuall, and diuelliſh.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of this Theological wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are matters divine, both for their Nature, and the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering: for whereas a Subiect hath two partes, the one which containeth the place of the matter, &amp; is called the thing conſidered: the other of the forme, and is the manner of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it: wee obſerue them both in the explication of this ſubiect: <hi>The thing conſidered</hi> is God himſelfe, and all thinges diſpoſed vnto God, that is all thinges divine, eyther of their owne nature, or by relation vnto God: <hi>The manner of conſidering</hi> is proportionable to Gods truth, even to the whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3172:15"/> truth, and everie part thereof alike (or equally) infuſed, fitted to the dignity of the deliverer to the nature of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo to the condition of thoſe, to whome it is delivered.</p>
            <p>And this is the nature and verity of Divinity: now wee will briefly ſhew the Methode of our Inſtitution concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold <hi>Methode</hi> of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the one from Principles, the other vnto Principles, the one <hi>a Priori</hi> proceeding from the Cauſe to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and from the firſt and higheſt to the loweſt and laſt: the other <hi>a Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> proceeding from the Effect to the Cauſe, or from the laſt and loweſt to the higheſt and firſt: The vſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is chiefeſt in ſciences contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, of the latter, in the practicke (or actiue.)</p>
            <p>Now whereas Divinity in both theſe holdeth the firſt &amp; principal place, (by reaſon wherof, ſome haue diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed it into Contemplatiue and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue) and for that it affordeth a faculty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3172:15"/> both of knowing and doing well, which is the right way of wiſedome: it hath fallen out that D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For whereas all order is taken ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the nature of thinges to bee conſidered. or from our better and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier knowledge thereof, <hi>Calvin, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthon, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus,</hi> haue done well, who obſerved an order of their better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a method, vnfoulding by way of Analyſis<note n="g" place="margin">Analyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Wee call the Canon the doctrine, that is contayned in the Bookes of both Teſtaments, the forme whereof inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is the vnchaungeable trueth of God: but the externall is the holy Scripture, the moſt abſolute Symbole of the ſame, for God hath vſed and ſanctified the Inſtrument of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it were the Index or declarer of that Eſſentiall Canon, and the truth of the worde for the approving of the truth, as it were in a certaine ſtate or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3172:21"/> habite of an externall forme, that by divine ordinance it might bee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of our faith and life, as a right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meaſure both whole and perfect.</p>
                  <p>The nature and office of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non come now to be declared.</p>
                  <p>The Nature, for whereas even vnto this day, there hath beene a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Canon in the Church, the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the other Eccleſiaſticall, and the thirde falſe; how the Canon properlie called divine may be diſtinguiſhed from the Eccleſiaſticall, and both from the falſe, it is very needefull for vs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, firſt by the partes thereof, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the manner of delivering: thirdly, by theyr proper conditions.</p>
                  <p>Wee devide the pattes of this Canon into the bookes of the olde and new Teſtament, according to thoſe two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times of the olde and new Church.</p>
                  <p>The olde Canon is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receyved from God, the auncient Church of the Iewes kept, and next after delivered from hand to hand to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3172:21"/> theyr poſterity by Gods appointment: the bookes whereof are reckoned to be 22. by the Iewes, but more diſtinctly by vs 39. and are divided into three rankes: the firſt contayneth the fiue Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſecond contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the bookes of the Prophets, both hyſtoricall and propheticall, whereof ſome were publiſhed before the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to wit, the booke of <hi>Ioſhua, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Ruth,</hi> two of <hi>Samuel,</hi> two of <hi>Kinges</hi> being hyſtoricall, <hi>Eſay,</hi> a good part of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and the nine leſſer Prophets being Propheticall: Others were in the time of Captivity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as <hi>Eſdras. Nehemias, Eſter,</hi> which are hyſtoricall: ſome part of <hi>Ieremie, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the three laſt of the ſmaller Prophets, which are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall: the thirde contayneth holy writings before the Captivity, <hi>Iob,</hi> the greateſt part of the Pſalmes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbes, Eccleſiaſtes, the ſongs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> in and after the Captivity, the two bookes of Chronicles.</p>
                  <p>The New Canon is that which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3172:22"/> the chriſtian church had more largely ſince the time of Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: the ſubſtance of which Canon is the word by Chriſt vttered, and the thinges which hee did: the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hyſtory whereof is contayned in the fower Evangeliſts: the examples in the Acts, the<note n="y" place="margin">Exegeſis.</note> expoſition in one &amp; twenty Epiſtles, the Propheſie in the booke of Revelation.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the delivery of both the Canons varyed according to the times of the church and perſons: the internall forme that is the vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable word of God remayning ſtil the ſame: for as, for the time being, the law or the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> were the Canon in the church, ſo alſo after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that which was added thereunto, was the<note n="z" place="margin">Exegetica</note> fuller expoſition of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or canon.</p>
                  <p>The conditions of this Canon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called divine are two, the one that it contayne in it ſelfe the truth, or haue the expreſſe forme of the word of truth: the ſecond, that it bee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3172:22"/> ruled and ſanctified by divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to the end it might bee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non for vs in the church, the latter of which conditions can never bee pluckt away from the former.</p>
                  <p>Now God hath ſanctified theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde bookes, to the ende they might be a Canon in the church, partly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a generall, partly after a particular manner, after a <hi>Generall manner,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath approved and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Bookes of both Canons, not onely by the teſtimony of his ſpirit, but alſo by the conſent of the Canon, and teſtification of the church, after a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, becauſe God hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſanctified the Bookes of the olde Canon, to wit <hi>Moſes</hi> his fiue Bookes, with his ſpeech, miracles, ſignes and events: the bookes of the Prophets, and holy writings before the captiuity, with the extraordinary ſignes of a cloud and ſmoake in the Temple,<note n="g" place="margin">1. Kin. 8.10. Leu. 16.2.</note> as alſo of Gods anſwere by the Ephod, Vrim, and Thumim,<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 28 30.</note> after the captivity with ſingular teſtimonies of eventes, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3172:23"/> bookes alſo of the new Canon, God hath ſanctified ſingularly, both by his ſonne made manifeſt in the fleſh, as alſo by his wordes and deedes,<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> and by the Miniſtery of his Apoſtles which was moſt effectuall in ſignes, powers &amp; miracles,<note n="d" place="margin">Mat 3.5 pag. 13.</note> And theſe are the partes, manner and conditions of the divine Canon.</p>
                  <p>The other Canon is Eccleſiaſticall, which neyther contayneth the truth perfectly in it ſelfe, nor was ſanctified by God in the Church, that it might bee a Canon of doctrine and faith, and therefore is called of the Greeke fathers a ſecond or inferiour Canon. To this Canon belong the Bookes Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, eyther wholy ſo, as the thirde and fourth of <hi>Eſdras, Tobit, Iudith,</hi> the two bookes of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> the booke of <hi>Wiſedome, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> or being<note n="e" place="margin">Appendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> additions to the canonicall, as <hi>Baruch,</hi> the prayer of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and thoſe which are added to <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eſther:</hi> theſe, although they be taken into the Canon Eccleſiaſticall, yet by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3172:23"/> evident meanes that is by faith, order, and vſe, they were of the Fathers leſſe eſteemed then the bookes of that divine Canon, whereby, though abuſiuely they were called Canonicall, to witte, by cuſtome, yet properly they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the church from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, by the name of Apocrypha.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Falſe Canon</hi> is that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Authority of the Apocrypha bookes, grew greater, was conſtituted by humaine opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The office of the Canon</hi> is twofold, the one is to teach the truth, the other, by this rule of truth to decide al controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies concerning Religion: for it is the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Formall Cauſe</hi> of the holy Scripture is twofold, inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the one is wherby the Scripture is proportionable to the divine truth, and with euery part of it ſelfe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the exquiſite Phraſe of the holy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3172:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſcripture, whereby all things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a ſtile fitly tempered both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dignity of the ſpeaker, and the nature of the word ſpoken, and laſtly, according to the condition of them, to whome it is ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>From both as alſo from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the other cauſes, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the holy Scripture aryſeth, both as touching it ſelfe, and oppoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt vnwritten traditions.</p>
                  <p>As touching it ſelfe, becauſe the ſcripture doth moſt perfectly contayne the whole truth which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the perfection ſpringeth from principle, ſubiect, and effect.</p>
                  <p>From principle, for whereas every principle whether of the thing or of knowledge, ought to bee perfect and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Neyther is it onely perfect of it ſelfe, but alſo as being oppoſed to vnwritten traditions: all which by the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, it excludeth<note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe which are ſayed to bee <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue,</hi> are the names of the perſons, of which there is no commeation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but are ſeverally proper to the ſeverall perſons, to witte, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>Of this diſcription there are two members, the one of the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Eſſence: the other of the <hi>Perſons</hi> and the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the perſons, which two can neyther bee ſeparated from the declaration of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor ought to bee confounded in the ſame: for as there is an exceeding great and indiviſible vnity of the divine Eſſence in the plurality of the perſons: (for the Eſſence of the Father is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt:) ſo is there a reall and different <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the perſons in the vnity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, (for to be the Father is not to be the Sonne or the holy Ghoſt.)</p>
                  <p>We diſcerne the vnity of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> two wayes: firſt by the verity of the Eſſence: ſecondly, by the manner of Vnity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> is that wherby God both

                  <p>The manner of vnity, is not of knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, nor of the generall, nor of the ſpeciall, nor of conſent, but of number, becauſe there cannot be many Gods.</p>
                  <p>This manner of the vnity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by three arguments, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture, both very many and evident, even of the olde and new Teſtament,<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 6.4 Eſa. 44.6. 1.

               <p>PVrpoſing to ſpeake of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee muſt declare firſt what Name it is, ſecondly, what thing it is.</p>
               <p>Whereas to Predeſtinate, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and ordayne things to their ends,<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8.29. Eph. 1.5.</note> according to the manifold reſpect, &amp; conſideration of thoſe ends; it is wont to be taken diverſly among the Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now the ends generally, to which things created are ordayned, are two: the one, is that to which thinges are carried by the order of nature, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature, by the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God: the other is that which exceedeth the proportion (or meaſure) of the created nature, and reſpecteth the ſtate of man
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3172:53"/> out of this temporall and naturall life: the one, of the Schoole-men is called <hi>Proportionate,</hi> the other <hi>Superexce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reſpect of the former end, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is a decree of God, or a iudgement of Gods vnderſtanding, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in generall of all thinges created,<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 4.28.</note> as in ſpeciall of all Creatures reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which were to be put over to their certaine end. And in this ſignification it is alſo of others called Providence, and by vs was ſayde to be a kind of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and immanent actions of God, in reſpect of the latter end. Predeſtination is taken two wayes<note n="c" place="margin">Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chice.</note> Synecdochically, even as the ſtate of man out of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life is two-fold, eyther commonly or Improperly, for the eternall decree of God concerning men to bee ſaved or puniſhed, or ſingularly and properly, for the Act of decreeing vnto eternall ſalvation; which was in the minde (or vnderſtanding) of God: and in this ſignification wee take Predeſtination in this place.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:3172:54"/>
               <p>This Predeſtination is to bee diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two wayes or by two degrees, firſt in it ſelfe, and the cauſes thereof ſimply: ſecondly, oppoſitely vnto the contraries of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Predeſtination therefore is an Act of Gods good pleaſure, wherby God from everlaſting purpoſed in himſelfe, out of the vniverſality of Creatures to make ſome and certaine of them partakers of his grace &amp; glory in Chriſt to his prayſe and their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Primary Efficient Cauſe of this Predeſtination is God, in whome, and from whome the very Act of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, as it were from his divine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and in it fore-ſhapened altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (or alwayes) going before all things and cauſes:<note n="d" place="margin">2. Eph. 1.5. Rom. 8.29 2. Tim. 1.23.</note> ſecondly, Impulſiue, which is the benevolent (or well-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) affection of the Will of God in Chriſt, which in Scripture is called the <hi>good pleaſure of the Will of God</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1.5.</note>.</p>
               <p>And this act of Gods good pleaſure, which in God is ſimple and vniforme, according to our humane manner of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3172:54"/> hath two, as it were diſtinct Predeſtinations: the former is of the end, the latter of the meanes vnto the end: that diſtinctly we vſe to cal electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fore-knowledge:<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.2. Rom. 9.11 8.29.</note> but this by a common name, purpoſe<note n="g" place="margin">Prothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> and Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but both of them is a fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from everlaſting, before all things and the cauſes that were in the things<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 9 19. Act. 13.48 Rom. 9.11 &amp; 11.6.</note>.</p>
               <p>The matter of Predeſtination, or to ſpeake more properly, the Obiect is man, who out of the common nature of his kind, was to bee lifted vp or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: Of this obiect according to that double reſpect of the act of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there ought to be a double co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for if you reſpect the fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the end, man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly &amp; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 9.20. &amp; 21.35.</note> is the matter of Predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but if of the means vnto the end, man is, who was to periſh of himſelfe, and in himſelfe &amp; guilty in <hi>Adam</hi>

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:3172:55"/>
               <p>In reſpect of Decree, the order of degrees<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> is this Fore-knowledge, by which God fore-knew them that were to bee Predeſtinated: afore appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a determining purpoſe, by which God hath fore-determined the Predeſtination of them, that were fore-knowne, both by electing them from everlaſting, and by preparing for them elected grace in the preſent world, and glory in that to come.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of Execution, the order of degrees is this, an effectuall vocation,<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> Iuſtification, and Glorification, that is, a gratious beginning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this is the manner of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination in it ſelfe, and the cauſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſimply: wee muſt now conſider of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3172:55"/> the oppoſites and contraries of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Of theſe although there bee a diverſe reſpect, yet Sinecdochically, it is wont to bee ſignified and ſhewed by the common name of reprobation: in which ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is diſtinguiſhed both from eternall Predeſtination, which abuſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is called Reprobation, as alſo from that part of Gods decree, which eyther Logically is called <hi>Non Election,</hi> or Theologically a<note n="q" place="margin">Preteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> paſſing by, &amp; which properly is called Reprobation.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as being oppoſite to Predeſtination whereof wee haue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it ſignifieth that whole fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and maner of order vnto the end, wherevnto the Reprobates are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of it we muſt ſpeake in the firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</p>
               <p>Now Reprobation is an Act of Gods pleaſure (or decree) whereby God from everlaſting hath purpoſed in himſelfe, to paſſe by the greater part of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of Creatures, as touching the communion of his healthfull and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3172:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> grace and glory, and the ſame alſo before hand to condemne, that were not like to abide or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Cauſe Efficient of this reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: firſt principall is God; ſecond, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue is his owne pleaſure and will.<note n="r" place="margin">Pro. 6.3 Eph. 1.11. Prou. 16.4</note>.</p>
               <p>But this act which in God is ſimple &amp; vniforme as touching vs, in reſpect of the order vnto the end, ought two waies to be conſidered and diſtinguiſhed: for there is in God firſt an act of<note n="ſ" place="margin">Preteriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</note> paſſing by, called of the Schoolemen, a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Paſſiue</hi> and <hi>Negatiue,</hi> before all thinges and cauſes that were like to be in the thinges, or from the thinges, whereof no other reaſon, eyther can be giuen, or ought to be ſought, beſides the pleaſure and will of God<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 9.11.12.13.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3172:56"/> before the cauſes fore-known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to bee like to bee in the thinges or from the thinges: but it is a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Act of ſinne, as the neceſſary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, becauſe as God in time iuſtly puniſheth, and condemneth man for ſinne: ſo God alſo from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hath iuſtly decreede to puniſh man, and fore-condemned him, by (or from) the<note n="x" place="margin">Ex Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi.</note> ſuppoſition of ſinne.</p>
               <p>The matter of Reprobation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the right obiect, are all and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reprobates, and the condition of this matter or obiect, according to that double reſpect of the Act, ought two wayes to bee conſidered: for as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that former Act of God and paſſing by, the matter of Reprobation is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bee Man in generall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of any quality,<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 9.11.</note> but as touching the latter, which is of Predamnation, or appointment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to puniſhment, the matter of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is man, in that he is a ſinner, or for his ſinnes to be puniſhed, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Gods iuſtice<note n="z" place="margin">Eph. 2.3.5.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The Cauſe Efficient of Creation is God: for the thinges created were not by one vnderſtanding conceyved, and by another procreated, as the <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> thought; not by another Nature, which <hi>Cerinthus</hi> calleth one while, the <hi>Wombe;</hi> another while, <hi>the Generall Worke,</hi> not by the Angels, as the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians deemed: not by their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſpirites, called <hi>Daemones,</hi> as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: Laſtly, not by Fortune, as Epicures; but by God they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and diſpoſed:<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 33.9.

                  <p>The perſons working in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation are, as the Cauſes: firſt, the Primordiall Cauſe is the Father,<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 17.24.</note> the working cauſe is the Sonne,<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 1.16 Ioh. 1.3.</note> and the perfecting (or finiſhing) cauſe is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 1.2.

                  <p>The manner of Creation is two-folde; the one by the bringing forth of things, the other; by the moſt wiſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them in order,<note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 9.8.

The conſideration of beginning is, that it ſhould loue ſingularity; and there can bee no vniverſall firſt thing, vnleſſe it bee one, neyther one vnleſſe it be God.</p>
                  <p>The matter of Creation ought to bee diſtinguiſhed two wayes, according as there is one creation primary &amp; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, &amp; another ſecondary, and mediate.</p>
                  <p>There was no primary matter of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neyther with God coeternal, nor of God exiſtent, or as a materiall cauſe put or ſpread vnder the work of this creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for God gaue not immediately the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of nature by nature, but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3172:63"/> &amp; for that he is of infinit power: he neceſſarily excludeth all matter; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of nothing, as it were the bound, God brought forth<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 33 9. Rom. 4.17 Heb. 11.3.</note> nature by his owne power.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſecond and mediate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the matter is two-fold: the firſt, and that which ſpringeth from the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt matter there is a double knowledge: the firſt in the pureneſſe of it owne nature abſolutely, and by it ſelfe: the other with a reſpect vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, as the beginning &amp; firſt ſubiect, of which thinges are made and conſiſt. In both notions it is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of <hi>Moſes;</hi> firſt, as touching the ſubſtance, in that it is partly earthly, &amp; partly watery; for herevnto tend the names of earth and water: Secondly, as touching the quantity, in that it is a<note n="i" place="margin">Jngens moles.</note> huge heape, and yet not onely a<note n="k" place="margin">Plaſma rationis.</note> worke of manner (or faſhion) but in very deed, a Being layde (or ſpreade) vnder all thinges: Thirdly, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quality, in that it was darke, &amp; obſcure, which the Spirite of God lay
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3172:63"/> vpon<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 1.1.2. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The matter of the Secondary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to witte, being that, which of the firſt ſprung, is wont to be ſhewed by the Name of Nature by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as by the names of heaven and earth in the ſcriptures.<note n="m" place="margin">Pſa. 124 8. &amp; 134.3. Eſa. 37.16.</note>.</p>
                  <p>For of the thinges drawne forth of that firſt matter, there are two ſortes plainely differing between themſelues, although Analogically, they are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the common reſpect of one kind: for ſome are Compound, Elementall, and Materiall in this world, which are manifeſted by the name of Earth: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome are Simple and Immateriall, aboue this world, in the heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by God ſet in order, which are made knowne by the Name of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>By the manner of them a two-folde Nature is made: to witte, an Inferior, and Superior: the one is conſidered in this vniverſalneſſe of thinges naturall, in which man alſo is: the other in the vniverſality of thinges, put aboue the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3172:64"/> nature of this world, in which alſo are the Angels: the truth and manner of both may more conveniently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the forme of Creation.</p>
                  <p>The Forme of Creation, to wit, of that which is Primary, is both that hidden force of divine Power, put into that firſt matter, according to the being and conditions of the ſame: as alſo the Externall, Immediate, and inſtant bringing forth of the matter, &amp; the ſtate thereof, without ſhape and order: But, of that which is Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary, the Forme Internall, is that common and hidden nature of the whole frame, which God hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all thinges after a common meane and manner: but the externall, whereof ſpeech is here, is that powerfull bringing forth of all thinges, out of the firſt matter in the beginning of time, by the ſpace of ſixe dayes; as alſo the moſt godly diſpoſing of the ſame, both in themſelues, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 1. per totum caput.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Now the truth of this bringing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3172:64"/> forth, and diſpoſing is two wayes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, according as the Nature of the thinges brought forth and diſpoſed, is two-fold: the one is Inferior, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall &amp; materiall: the other, ſuperior, ſimple and Immateriall<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 1.10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Of this Inferior Nature, there are two parts; Elementall, and Ethereall.</p>
                  <p>The Elementall part, is of bodies, by their Nature, ſubiect to change, below the Region of the skie, whether they be ſimple or compound.</p>
                  <p>The Simple Bodies are the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the beginnings of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, which in a moſt godly &amp; moſt convenient order were at firſt created<note n="p" place="margin">Ge. 1. to v. 10.</note>.

                  <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of this Providence or governement is the ſame, which is of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3172:69"/> Creation, ſith the one, and the ſelf fame beginning is of both: from &amp; by which all things proceed &amp; are conſerved, to witte, God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 32.13.15. &amp; 139.78. Ioh. 12.34.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Father, or the loue, and goodnes of the Father, is the firſt beginning cauſe. The Sonne, in that he is the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and word is the working cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt, in that hee is the vertue and power of the Father, and the Sonne, is the finiſhing cauſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this efficient cauſe are according to degrees diſtinguiſhed; now they are diſtinguiſhed by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3172:69"/> order &amp; maner. The firſt is of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Governing:</hi> The third of <hi>Ordayning</hi> to the end: of which more at large in the formall cauſe of providence. The Matter, about which Providence is imployed, according to the twofold conſideration of the things which are ſubiect vnto it may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed two wayes: one way in reſpect of thoſe things which are, another way in reſpect of thoſe things which are don, for after both wayes &amp; reſpects, all and ſeverall things are ruled by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The things which are, ought three wayes to be diſtinguiſhed, firſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their nature: ſecondly, according to their Accidents: thirdly, according to their vſe. Of the nature of things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that ſuperior, or inferior, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of wee treated in the place of creation, there is a double knowledge: the one common, and according to their natural form or kind: the other ſingular, &amp; acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the<note n="d" place="margin">Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua.</note> things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as they are indiviſible. The Accidents, whatſoever they are, are either of common nature in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3172:70"/> its beginning &amp; perfection, or of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature in the defect and condition thereof,<note n="f" place="margin">Agnata.</note> beſides the courſe of nature.</p>
                  <p>Of things according to their vſe, there is a twofold diſtinction: for eyther they are the ends, or the means vnto the end: but the ends are, ſome furtheſt off, and ſome intermediate vnto the ſame: the meanes are ſeverally known two waies: firſt, after the manner of doing: for ſome are ordinary, ſome extraordinary, and both ordained to their proper ends: Secondly, by the quality, and eſſentiall condition of them: for ſome are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſome contingent.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe which are neceſſary, there are two kinds: for ſome are by themſelues abſolutely neceſſary, by a neceſſity of the Conſequent, as they call it; and ſome by the cauſe from a<note n="g" place="margin">Ex Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi.</note> Suppoſition by neceſſity of the Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which are abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when we treate of things created, we diſtinguiſh by two degrees. The firſt is in the firſt and common beginning of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; firſt by themſelues, and by all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3172:70"/> things neceſſary, as when wee ſay, that twice two is foure, which vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and by an infallible neceſſity are true. The other degree of neceſſity is from nature, out of it owne inward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, whether materiall, as when we ſay, that every thing compounded of contraries, muſt neceſſarily periſh; or Formal, as when we ſay, that the fire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily burneth.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, which are neceſſary by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or by neceſſity of condition, or conſequence, doe put one a neceſſity, eyther from the inward beginning, or from the outward, or from both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thinges contingent are thoſe, which may be, or not be; ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly happen to every <hi>Individuum</hi> (or ſingular thing): for the power is the matter, which is capable of things poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (or contingent,) and the matter is of every ſingular thing, and of every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum,</hi> which are limitted in their owne matter.</p>
                  <p>And this is the maner of thoſe things which are: now thoſe things, which are

                  <p>The Forme of Gods Providence, is that perpetuall Act of directing all and ſingular things vnto their proper ends: which act ought two wayes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and diſcerned, to witte, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſingular; by the one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers degrees of that act of Gods providence, by the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſingular nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubiects vpon which it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p>The Act of Gods providence is generaly diſcerned by three degrees, the declaration whereof is very neceſſary, for the vnderſtanding of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt degree is of Conſervation, whereby all and ſeverall thinges are ordinarily ſuſtayned in the ſame ſtate of Nature, and naturall properties, in which they were created.</p>
                  <p>This conſervation according to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3172:72"/> diſtinction of things, which either are, or are done, is both of Exiſtence, and of power.</p>
                  <p>The conſervation of Exiſtence, is the continuance of the ſubſtance of things, which had their being by creation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of a whole ſpeciall kind, or of any <hi>Individuum</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Pſa.. 19.12. &amp; 104 19.20. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The conſervation of Power is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God ſuſtayneth and moveth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per powers of every Creature, which pertayne to the operations and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, by a ſingular<note n="i" place="margin">Iob. 14.4 Heb. 9.27. Pſal. 134.2.3.</note> beginning which in thinges involuntary, is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular nature; in things voluntary is wil.</p>
                  <p>Both of them is from God, as from the vniverſall beginning, on whome the beginnings, both common and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, of thinges and actions doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. In which dependency two things are to bee noted; the one is that the ſame firſt beginning of the conſervation of things doe ſo worke in the inferiour beginnings, that it detracteth nothing from them, but ordinarily leaveth their Actions perfect: for God ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3172:72"/> all thinges, which hee hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hee ſuffereth them alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and doe their owne proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The other is, that, that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning worketh by thoſe which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, after the manner of thoſe Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: for as oft as many cauſes Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate (or together ordained) doe befal; the laſt effect followeth not the firſt cauſe, by neceſſity or contingence, but the neereſt cauſe: Hence is that tearm, Fate (or Deſtiny) natural, ſo termed by Chriſtians, which is a courſe and order of naturall cauſes, depending vpon the firſt cauſe; which vnleſſe they be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſame, of their owne power, &amp; nature bring forth the ſame effect.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond degree is of Governing, whereby God, in whoſe power is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority, diſpoſeth of al things, conſiſting in his own power, ruling the ſame according to the liberty of his owne will.</p>
                  <p>Of this Governing, there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration; the one conſiſting in Commanding, the other in Doing:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3172:73"/> the third in not Doing, which they cal Permitting: the firſt verily is of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> and therfore not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this place, the other two, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect the action of Gods provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Action therefore of God gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is two-fold; the one performing, the other permitting.</p>
                  <p>The Action performing is that, which of the Grecians is called (Fore-Knowledge, according to good pleaſure) whereby God effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth in all and ſeverall things, that which belongeth to his owne worke: Now hee performeth whatſoever is good in Nature, both common and particular, as the vniverſall beginning of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Action permitting is that which of the Grecians is tearmed (Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge according to permiſſion,) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God forbiddeth not the Actions of others; but permitteth to the will of the doer, the manner of them: Of this Permiſſion, there are in the Scripture two kindes: the one is of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3172:73"/> (a permiſſion,) Simple, and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ute, when GOD permitteth ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that, which hee might ſimply, and immediately hinder; as when hee permitted <hi>Adam</hi> to fall: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="k" place="margin">Ex Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi.</note> by Suppoſition; when God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a humane manner tempereth his permiſſions, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men: ſuch permiſſions as theſe, are very many in the Olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: both are in God from his owne will, and are moved to the end, which the will of God hath fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>The thirde Degree of GODS Providence, is of ordayning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God by his admirable Wiſedome bringeth all thinges, though moſt out of order, vnto their due order, and proper Ende.</p>
                  <p>In this ordayning, three thinges concurre, the appointment of the End, the diſpoſing of the meanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, and the directing of the meanes diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>The appointment of the End: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <p>This ſupreme end of thinges, though according to perfection ſignified, it be one onely: yet according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſignifying; which manner is from the obiects, it is two-fold: his moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Iuſtice, and Grace, which in God haue the reſpect of chiefeſt good.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this double End, there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſing of the meanes, according as there is fitly laied down by the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a double intent of God the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: the one by it ſelfe, chiefly, or firſt intended; becauſe aſwell it ſelfe, as all things vnto it ſelfe are intended: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by it ſelfe intended, but not chiefly or firſt: becauſe it ſelfe indeed is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but not all thinges therevnto: the intent, after the firſt way, is Gods

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3172:75"/> more difficult points therof) three things are to be noted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Nature and naturall properties of things, as they be, are from God, and that therefore according to the maner which God hath put into things, they are ſubiect to Gods providence.<note n="q" place="margin">Iob. 10 10.11. Exod. 15 26. Pſ. 105.17</note> And thus ſtands the maner &amp; nature of things, that ſome be neceſſary, ſome contingent; thoſe, (the order whereof betweene the Cauſe and the Effect, is vnchangeable) eyther abſolutely by themſelues, and of their owne Nature, or by Suppoſition and relation to the Cauſes propoſed; which nevertheleſſe, may eyther not be, or be changed: theſe, the order whereof, is mutable into both partes, of it owne nature indefinite, ſuch as are the things of nature, or thinges particular, which haue the conditions of mutability, and contingency infolded among themſelues, &amp; in themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is an effect of Gods providence, that any thing happeneth by what manner ſoever, whether contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, or neceſſarily: and therefore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3172:76"/> that falleth out neceſſarily, which Gods providence hath diſpoſed to fall out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; and that commeth to paſſe contingently, becauſe ſuch is the reaſon (or manner) of Gods providence: hence God being the vniverſall beginning, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediately or immediately cauſeth that the things ſtand both wayes, and that out of cauſes neceſſary, or contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Effects and Events neceſſary, and contingent are produced.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of what ſoever things, there is a contingency; of theſe there is alſo a neceſſity by ſuppoſition: and therfore nothing is ſo contingent, which may not two wayes be neceſſary by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: one way in it owne exiſtence: for what was to be contingent, the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it proceeded, muſt needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly haue, or formerly had a being. The other way by the determined decree, &amp; foreknowledge of God: in reſpect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all thinges come to paſſe infallibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to ſpeake properly, it is one thing that ſomewhat falleth out contingently; another thing neceſſarily, and another

                  <p>Theſe things layed down, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that all things both neceſſary, and contingent, are every way ſubiect to Gods Providence. 1. of Conſervation, becauſe both haue being and power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. 2. of Governing; for of both, God diſpoſeth according to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his will, whether effecting, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. 3. of Ordayning, becauſe God alſo hath preſcribed an end vnto them, according to their Nature, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixtly, as concerning Actions Naturall, and Voluntary: it is to be noted, that three beginnings of actions muſt be conſidered, and proportional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed: the one <hi>Vniverſall,</hi> is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3172:77"/> God, the other <hi>Generall,</hi> is Nature: the third <hi>Particular:</hi> and is eyther a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Inclination, or Inſtinct, or Will Electiue.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe beginnings, there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular properties: the vniverſall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is finite; the Generall is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the particular is defined in his Subiects: the firſt is from it ſelfe, and to it ſelfe: the ſecond hath a relation vnto God, the third vnto both.</p>
                  <p>Whence it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe actions, which are from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beginning mediately; are from God, by the generall beginning: but thoſe which are from the generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, are from God immediately.</p>
                  <p>Here it is evident, that all actions, whether naturall or voluntary, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Gods Providence: firſt, by way of Conſervation: for God conſerveth the Natures of thinges, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of will which hee hath given man: Secondly, by way of governing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, as hee is an vniverſall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, effectually moveth all other
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3172:77"/> beginnings, to doe (or worke:) thirdly, by way of ordayning: becauſe he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and directeth all actions vnto the end, which hee hath fore-appointed to them, whether Naturall, or Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 139.3.</note>
                  </p>

                  <p>One is, that according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the beginnings, whereof wee haue aboue ſpoken, the one, &amp; the ſelfe ſame action is both good &amp; evill; good as touching the generall, as it is from God and common Nature: for both God and Nature of themſelues, doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bring forth good actions: evil, according to the particular reſpect in man, as hee is corrupt: for every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious act taketh the neceſſity of the vice, from the neereſt cauſe, which is the will
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3172:78"/> of the offender: whence is that of the Schoolemen,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem Cauſalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis omnis in peccato, conſiſtere, penes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, quae impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat actum</note> that the chiefty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry procurement in ſinne conſiſteth in the power of the Will, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands the Act.</p>
                  <p>The other is, that in every Action, three thinges are to bee diſcerned, and diſtinguiſhed; the Nature, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, &amp; the Accidentall quality of them both.</p>
                  <p>The Nature is from the Creator, which gaue it, and moveth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of naturall properties and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The Subiect is the moving of the Action, which is according to nature, in reſpect whereof, every ſinne is ſaid to bee in God, ſubjectiuely.</p>
                  <p>The Quality is the Accident of Nature, and of the Subiect being good indeed, according to grace, but evill, according to the corruption that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in nature, and in the Subiect, which infecteth man; and thoſe things, which are of man, with a bodily and effectual taynt (or ſtrayne:) whence the will,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3172:78"/> which is the inward beginning of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, infuſeth the force of that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the actions immediately.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things layed downe, it is to bee marked, that Providence alſo in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill actions worketh by all the wayes &amp; and degrees.<note n="t" place="margin">Eſa. 45.7 Lam. 3.37 Am. 3.6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the way &amp; degree of Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for it hath put into man both the beginning of Nature, which by it ſelfe by a naturall neceſſity is limitted; as alſo the beginning of actions, which is the will, that by it owne power li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth her motions, and freely incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them vnto whatſoeuer actions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined: againe, it ſuſtayneth the will, as it moveth the things of nature, by a common beginning, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons naturall and voluntary, by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular beginning.</p>
                  <p>By way and degree of Governing: for firſt, God bringeth to paſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the worke, that is evill, as farre foorth, as it hath a reſpect of good; &amp; chiefly, it hath that, both becauſe it is in good, ſubiectiuely, &amp; becauſe it is

                  <p>In the way and degree of ordayning: for God ordayneth the events of ſinnes vnto good,<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> eyther morall (that is of puniſhment, and chaſtiſement:) or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, (that is, of his glory in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and mercy:)<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 5.20. &amp; 11.33.</note> wherby it is cleare, that for a thing to haue being, to doe, and to bee ordayned; it is good: but for the ſame to bee evill, to doe evill, and to bee carried vnto evill, it is euil; that God effecth, but this God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to bee effected by the creature: &amp; this is the formall cauſe of providence.</p>

               <p>THe Worke of God Externall, and Temporall, which he bringeth to paſſe in thinges, is twofold; of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3172:84"/> Nature, and of Grace.</p>
               <p>The Worke of Nature, whereof hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervnto we haue ſpoken, is, whereby God hath eyther created thinges, not as yet being, or conſerveth, governeth, and ordereth them, being created, by his Providence.</p>
               <p>The Worke of Grace, is that which God effecteth in the Elect, who ſhall be heyres of Salvation, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</p>
               <p>And this Worke commonly is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Redemption:</hi> for the explication of which worke, three thinges concurre: the beginning, the manner, and the Effect, or the Application thereof.</p>
               <p>The beginning is Chriſt, as hee is God and man; from whome there is no power, nor healthfull Action, which is needefull for Redemption, but doth proceed.</p>
               <p>The manner, according to which Chriſt executed this worke, is that holy diſpoſing, and diſpenſation of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>Now the Effect, or Application is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3172:84"/> diſcerned; firſt, by the degrees hereof, in this life; that is, by Calling, and by Iuſtification: Secondly, by outwarde meanes; that is, by Gods Covenant, and by his Sacraments: Thirdly, by the Subiect, that is the Church, which Chriſt hath redeemed with his blood.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, wee muſt treate firſt of Chriſts perſon: ſecondly, of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his perſon: Laſtly, of the other places pertayning to the application.</p>

                     <hi>The Part Confirmatiue.</hi> CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>THe neereſt ſingular and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate beginning of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Chriſt; as hee is God and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3172:85"/> man; becauſe, by him, Man was to be redeemed, in whome our redemption was from everlaſting Predeſtinated: by him againe to be reſtored, by whom at firſt he was created: in him he ought to bee made partaker of the loue of God, who was the Sonne of loue, (or the beloved Sonne:) and at laſt in him, to obtayne the right of Sonnes or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option; who, by Nature was the Sonne and heyre of God from everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt therfore, being God and man, is (as the ſcripture moſt briefly defineth) the Worde made fleſh, or God made manifeſt in the fleſh: that is a perſon, in whoſe ſingularity two Natures, (the properties thereof remayning whole,) are vnited for the Redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>For the explication of this Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we muſt conſider of three things in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the Natures, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, verity and actions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of the Subject of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or of the perſon, and of both the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3172:85"/> Vnity, and the operation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of the Hypoſtaticall vnion of the Natures, and of the manner, foundation, power, and efficacy thereof.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Natures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Nature is an outward beginning, making the thing it ſelfe, and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing it from other things; we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge two ſuch natures in Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, Divine, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: both in themſelues, and in their properties diſtinct:<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9 1 1. Ioh. 5.20. Phil. 2.6.</note> the one from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, immutable, immortall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible: the other in time conceyved, and borne, mutable, mortall, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Both are Indiviſibly neceſſary for the redemption of mankind, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the office of a Mediator: the divine (Nature) that hee might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie God; that the ſatiſfaction might bee proportionable to our debt; that an Infinite good might helpe an Infinite evill, by overcomming death, and by vndergoing both the heavines of ſinne,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3172:86"/> and the infiniteneſſe of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Adde further, that whereas the arbitrement betweene God and man, is aboue the humanity; becauſe no man can bee a chiefe and ſupreme meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of divine thinges; but God by his God-head; becauſe no working aboue nature; ſuch as is a ſufficient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with God, is of (or from nature,) becauſe no beginning, but of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelfe, can bee the beginning of that ſatiſfaction, which may ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; it muſt needes bee, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine nature in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee tooke on him, all the partes of Mediation, (or Mediatorſhip.)</p>
                  <p>But the humane, that being man, hee might according to the Law, ſatiſfie Gods juſtice, that hee might ſufficiently ſuffer for the accompliſhment of the worke of ſatiſfaction, both by obeying, made vnder the law, and by dying, made a curſe according to the Law; that in all thinges being like vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſinne excepted, hee might bee a faithfull, and vniverſall high Prieſt in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3172:86"/> thoſe thinges, which are to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before God, to purge the ſinnes of the people.<note n="b" place="margin">He. 2.17</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the divine Nature of Chriſt (that wee may in few wordes ſpeake touching the verity of thoſe Natures,) is that, whereby hee obtayneth the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt: albeit, both according to his perſon, whereby hee is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to bee the Sonne of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpenſation of his office, whereby hee is diſcerned to bee a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, hee is diſtinguiſhed from the eſſence of God: of which nature we haue more largely treated in the place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God,</p>
                  <p>The humane Nature of Chriſt is that, whereby hee holdeth the ſame Eſſence with vs, both the manner of ſubſiſting or being a perſon, and the vitious accidents, and ſinnes of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being excepted.</p>
                  <p>For neyther is the humane nature of Chriſt any thing by it ſelfe ſubſiſting, without dependance: but being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3172:87"/> ſubſiſting, was aſſumed in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularneſſe of perſon, without any ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuſion of natures, or diviſion of perſon<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 2.6. Ioh. 1.1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Neyther could any contagion of ſinne infect that humane nature of Chriſt, the ſubſtance whereof being otherwiſe in it ſelfe, corrupt originally, the vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable operation of the holy Spirite ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and moſt fully purged from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpot: nor yet ought (to infect,) as being that wherein the purging of our ſinnes, was to be performed<note n="d" place="margin">Luc. 1.35. Heb. 4.15.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges excepted, Chriſt tooke our true and Reall Nature, &amp; the ſame both whole and perfect, according to the ſubſtance, properties, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subſtance;</hi> for Chriſt had both our whole Nature, and the Eſſentiall parts of it whole.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>whole Nature:</hi> for hence is he called in the Scriptures, The ſeede of the Woman,<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 3. &amp; 22.16.</note> the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſeede of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, or the fruite of his loynes,<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 2.30</note> and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3172:87"/> very where the Sonne of man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Partes:</hi> for hee had both a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soule, and an Inſtrumentall body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A reaſonable Soule:</hi> this the Scripture, and<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 10.17. Mat. 26.38</note> the end of his Incarnation proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: for, that which is not aſſumed, is incurable. The <hi>Verity of Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the other partes of man haue their beauty by the Soule.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Inſtrumentall Body:</hi> this proued the verity of his humane Nature, which requireth a limitted matter: that is a fleſhly and an earthly body:<note n="h" place="margin">Luc. 22.42.</note> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſatiſfaction, which ought to bee made in a body truly paſſible, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: Laſtly, the verity of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for Chriſt ſhewed even by ſignes that hee had a body, not phantaſticall, or heavenly, but fleſhly, and earthly.<note n="i" place="margin">Luc. 2.40 Mat. 4.2. Ioh. 11.35 Ioh. 4.6. Mat 8.24. Mat. 27.50. Iob. 19.27</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The properties which Chriſt coaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are eyther of the whole nature: to witte, to bee created, and to bee finite, or of the partes, as of the Soule: for he had vnderſtanding,<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> and will,<note n="l" place="margin">Luc. 22.42.</note> &amp; the operations of both, and of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3172:88"/> for hee had a ſhape, quantity and circumſcription, and all the properties and naturall actions of a body.<note n="m" place="margin">Luc. 2.40. Mat. 4.2. Ioh. 11.35 Ioh. 4.6. Mat. 8.24. Mat. 27.50. Iob. 19.27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Infirmities: for it was behouefull; for the end of his Incarnation, that hee ſhould wholy take vnto him all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defects, ſinne excepted; for of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſome are ſimply miſerable, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tearmeth them, and ſome damnable; or as <hi>Damaſcene</hi> calleth them, Deteſtable: thoſe Chriſt wholy tooke, becauſe they were no let to his perfection, knowledge, and grace:<note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 1.14 1. Tim. 3.16. Heb. 5.7.</note> but theſe hee did not ſo, becauſe they had hindered our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe natures, the neceſſity, and verity whereof hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there are divers operations;<note n="o" place="margin">1. Pet. 3.18.</note> for there are two natures in Chriſt, as it were two inwarde, and effectuall beginninges; out of which formally, Actions, and their manners, are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: wherefore, as all thinges in Chriſt, (his ſubſiſting onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) are two-fold, (or of two ſorts)
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3172:88"/> to witte, his Nature, Properties, Will, Knowledge:<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 11.27. &amp; 23.37. Ioh. 2.19. 1. Cor. 15.27. Luc. 2.47.</note> ſo are there two-folde operations; ſome divine, ſome humane, diſtinguiſhed by their beginninges, manners of doing, and the particular Actions of each of them.</p>
                  <p>By their beginninges: becauſe, looke how many Natures there are; ſo many formall beginnings of actions there are.</p>
                  <p>By the manners of doing: for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning worketh according to it owne manner, and condition: the God-head, after a ſupernaturall, and divine manner: the man-hoode af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Naturall and Humane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>By particular Actions; for the <hi>Worde</hi> worketh that, which is of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that, which is of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> without any confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Natures, in the vnity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the other thing followeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3172:89"/> their Subject; that is, the perſon, and both the vnity and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Of the Perſon of Chriſt, there is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually held, and declared a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the Scriptures: the one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the Eſſence of the Word; the other in regard of the office and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of Eſſence; Chriſt, being conſidered, or ſeverally, (or without commixture,) as <hi>Nazianzene</hi> ſpeaketh; is in the divine Eſſence; another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the others, but not another thing.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the diſpenſation, which wee conſider of in this place; he is that ſecond perſon of the God-head, Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; that is, that perſon, who tooke mans Nature, by creating it in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of his ſubſiſtance immediately, and by his perſon vnited the ſame with the divine nature mediately; ſo as Chriſt is one of both Natures, not two into both: one, and the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out time begotten of the Father; the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3172:89"/> Sonne of God without mother; and in time begotten of the Virgine; the Sonne of man without Father, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and conſubſtantiall Sonne of both.</p>
                  <p>This Vnity of Perſon, three things, doe proue: firſt, the authorities of the Scripture, for Chriſt is, as the Prophet teacheth, <hi>Emanuel:</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Eſa. 7.</note> as the Angell teacheth the ſame Sonne of God, which ſhould bee borne of <hi>Mary:</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luc. 1.35</note> as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt teacheth; the Word made fleſh:<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 1.1.</note> as the Apoſtle teacheth, the ſame, who came of the Father accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh who is God aboue all things to be prayſed for ever.<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 9.5</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the end of his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe, that God, and man might bee made one in the Covenant; It was behoofefull, that one ſhould bee made God and man in perſon, not by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of grace, but by verity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not by confuſion of ſubſtance; but by vnity of Perſon:</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the denominations of both natures, attributed to the ſame Subject:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3172:90"/> for as thoſe thinges are not incident to the divine nature, which are proper to the humane; nor thoſe vnto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which are peculiar to the divine, ſo all in common, and according to truth, are vttered of the perſon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both Natures:<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 20.28. 1. Cor. 2.8</note> therefore the one and the ſame perſon is Eternal, and not Eternall; Infinite, and Finite; holding all the divine and humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; thoſe from everlaſting, as he is God: theſe in time aſſumed, as he is man: both really, yet Intranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, as he is man-God.</p>
                  <p>This Perſon is the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thoſe actions, which the Greeke Fathers haue called divinely Humane: for the actions of Chriſt are not onely, ſome humane, ſome divine: but alſo ſome of common operation, which Chriſt effecteth; both as he is Man-God by Nature, and as hee is Mediator by diſpenſation: his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the beginninges of Naturall Actions; but his perſon is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both of common and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3172:90"/> actions, according to both natures: wherefore every working of Chriſt, in reſpect of his perſon, is in number one; in reſpect of his Natures, is in kinde, two-folde: One in number, becauſe hee is one effectuall Worker: and one abſolute Perfection. In kinde two-folde, becauſe there is one Divine, of the God-head, and another humane, of the man-hood.</p>
                  <p>The laſt remayneth, concerning the Hipoſtaticall Vnion of the two Natures in Chriſt: the <hi>Nature, Foundation, Power,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> whereof, are now briefly to bee expounded.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of this Vnion we ſhall diſcerne by the definition and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: for it is a Perſonall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of two Natures in Chriſt; a conjunction, I ſay Perſonall, not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and of two Natures, yet not Naturall: not ſuch as is of thinges Superiour with the Inferiour; of the Accidentes with the Subſtances; or the parte with the whole; but, in that both mediately, the two
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3172:91"/> Natures are vnited in the perſon; and immediately the humane Nature is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the perſon, after a ſecret and moſt ſtraite manner.<note n="y" place="margin">1. Tim. 3.18. Gal. 4.4. Col. 2.9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence this vnion, which in very deed is one in the manner of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is vſually tearmed, and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to be two-fold: the one immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, of the perſon aſſuming, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature aſſumed; for the humane nature, it owne<note n="z" place="margin">Perſona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litate.</note> Perſon-head, (that I may ſo ſay,) being forſaken, (or left,) came vnto the perſon already perfect, not to be perfected, (by that) of which it was aſſumed, that it whole might ſubſiſt in the whole perſon;<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 1.1.2.3. &amp;c. Ioh. 1.14. Heb. 2.14.</note> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediate, of two natures, between themſelues, wrought by meanes of the perſon, without any, eyther confuſion of Natures, or diviſion of perſon.</p>
                  <p>Not by the confuſion of Natures: for it is made Immutably, and inconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly; the Eſſentiall Natures, and their properties, which neyther ſhould bee confounded, nor can bee tranſfuſed, being diſtinct and entire, ſo, that they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3172:91"/> be neyther confounded between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor changed each one in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Not by Diviſion of Perſon: for it is made Indiviſibly, and Inſeparably; ſo that neyther the humane Nature from the perſon, nor the natures in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from themſelues, are any while, or any where ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation or ground of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the Incarnation: the Efficient Cauſe of this Inchoatiuely, (as the Schoole-men ſpeake) is the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but <hi>Terminatiuely,</hi> Chriſt himſelfe is, being made that, which he was not; and yet remayning in the meane while, that, which he was.</p>
                  <p>Of this Incarnation there are two partes, Conception, and Nativity: both are ordinary, as touching the Verity of the matter: for Chriſt tooke vnto him a Nature like to ours, of the Subſtance of <hi>Mary:</hi> yet extraordinary, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner; that is, both of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the wombe of <hi>Mary,</hi> and of Aſſumption, and of Sanctification, as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3172:92"/> alſo laſtly, in reſpect of fulfilling, or accompliſhment; for the forming was immediate in the Virgine, without the meanes of a man,</p>
                  <p>The Sanctifying was from all ſpotte of ſinne, whether Habituall or Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: the Aſſumption was made into the vnity of Perſon, without any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Laſtly, the fulfilling was according to the Propheſies.</p>
                  <p>From this vnion, (that in few wordes wee may expreſſe the power thereof,) two things follow; the Communion of natures, and the communication of properties.</p>
                  <p>The Communion is in very deede the ſame with the vnion of Natures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Subſiſtence: yet in manner of conſideration, it differeth, becauſe that is, as it were, the Effecte, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this; for this communion of natures doth properly ſignifie a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance of properties, and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of both natures in the worke of mediation, concurring together vnto one abſolute perfection: by reaſon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3172:92"/> whereof it commeth to paſſe, that the proper things of each nature be, and are ſayde to bee common in the perſon: and this is the ground of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the properties.</p>
                  <p>For it is a Phraſe of ſpeaking, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the property of one nature is really vttered, concerning the whole perſon of Chriſt: yet ſo, that it properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto one nature in reſpect of the thing itſelfe; and vnto the other, in reſpect of another thing: for wee ſay, that God purchaſed his Church by his blood,<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 20.8.</note> that Chriſt being man is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where:<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 3.13</note> and this is (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call it,) That grace of the vnion, by reaſon of which wee may ſay of Chriſt, that God is man, and man is God; Chriſt is God and man.</p>
                  <p>Now this communication is after a divers manner, both Reall, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball: Reall, becauſe of the vnion of the Natures, and the vnity of the perſon: for Chriſt is one, who being God, hath that which is humane in the verity of humane nature: and being man, hath
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3172:93"/> that which is divine in the verity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature: the ſame in the Sonne, God and man: wherefore as the word, becauſe of the fleſh, is man; ſo the fleſh, becauſe of the word, is God: and yet, neyther is eyther the humane nature coextended with the divine; nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine concluded in the humane: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that, looke what<note n="e" place="margin">Idiomata</note> properties in the concretiue name are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the perſon, according to both natures: theſe in the Abſtract, in each natures are not communicated, becauſe they are properties.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the vniverſall preſence, omnipotence, and omniſcience, no leſſe then Eternity it ſelfe, and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſiblenes are the ſelfe Eſſential things of God, or his Eſſentiall properties, which cannot bee communicated: now to bee every where, to bee omnipotent, omniſcient, as to bee Eternall, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible; are truely vttered of Chriſt, being man; not according to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother perſon, but according to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing by the communication of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3172:93"/> properties, which is true, ſo farre foorth as the thing it ſelfe is true.</p>
                  <p>From this Reall communication of properties, wee muſt diſtinguiſh that reall communication of gifts naturall &amp; ſupernaturall made by the divine nature; the gifts of the humane, as well accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it ſelfe, as in the perſon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome pertayne to the perfection of the fleſh aſſumed, and ſome to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of office.</p>
                  <p>The gifts of Perfection, are all thoſe, wherewith the aſſumed nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it ſelfe, and in it ſelfe, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched; whether they bee thoſe, which by force of the Vnion, the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt enjoyeth after a moſt bleſſed manner; or thoſe, which were put in, and infuſed, and that in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, that ever a humane nature can attayn: or laſtly, whether they were gotten by habite, as thoſe, which Chriſt ſucceſſiuely tooke, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, vntill his nature was brought vp vnto the perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:3172:94"/>
                  <p>The giftes of power or office, are thoſe, which in reſpect of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee receyved in time, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to eyther Nature apart, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the whole perſon, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was incarnate; that in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and according to them both, hee might performe the healthfull office of a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>The Verball Communication is ſayde to bee that, which pertayneth to the expoſition of wordes and Phraſes which offer themſelues in the holy Scriptures, and by which, that which is proper to one nature, is vttered of the other by name onely, by reaſon of the Identity of the perſon, and the vniting together of the properties in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Now, as there are three ſortes of Names, whereby the Subject is vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning Chriſt: ſo there are three kindes of Attributes, which of him are pronounced: for ſome agree with the divine nature onely, ſome with the humane onely, and ſome with both
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3172:94"/> natures in his perſon: thoſe which are of the firſt and ſecond ſort, are Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable: thoſe which are of the third, are ſpoken of Chriſt in his perſon, in reſpect of both Natures.</p>
                  <p>From this difference both of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Predicates, a double manner of Predication or Declaration ariſeth; proper and ſimple: improper and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.</p>
                  <p>Proper, is when eyther thoſe things which are true in the Subject; that is, in the perſon, according to eyther na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; are likewiſe pronounced of the ſame; and therefore that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced divine, concerning the perſon, is vnderſtoode to bee true, according to the divine nature; and that which is pronounced humane, according to the humane: as the Sonne of God is <hi>every where, Almightie, Eternall;</hi> the Sonne of man is <hi>borne, Dead,</hi> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> or when the Predicate, common to both natures is vttered, (or pronounced,) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a common name of the Subiect, as Chriſt redeemed vs with his blood.</p>

                  <p>FRom the perſon redeeming, wee paſſe to the manner of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the office of Chriſt doth circumſcribe: for, whereas the manner of Redemption comprehendeth all that action, courſe, and manner of Chriſt which he hath performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordering, diſpoſing, and diſpenſation of both his Fathers will, and his owne; wee muſt throughly diſcerne them by their degrees, and the degrees of the office of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now wee diſcerne them partly; Generally, according to a common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3172:102"/> partly ſingularly, according to their ſpeciall kindes and partes.</p>
                  <p>Generally, the office of Chriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be an office of mediation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Sonne</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 5 5.

                  <p>The Cauſe efficient of this office eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially is God, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt,<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 1.9 Eſa. 61.1.</note> but yet, the order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding being kept; to witte, both that which is inward of the perſons among themſelues, and that, which is outward, as touching the things created: for in reſpect of both; it commeth to paſſe, that the Father, from whome is both the Eſſence, and vertue of working, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beginning, is ſayde to be the Efficient cauſe of this office: of whom the Sonne is annoynted, both as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the calling, and as touching the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of Gifts: the latter whereof, properly pertayneth to the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3172:102"/> the former to both: Now the forme is ſayde to bee the meane (or mediating) cauſe, by order of perſon, from the Father, but by diſpenſation of office, ſubordinate<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 14.28.</note> to the Father.</p>
                  <p>The matter of this office is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two wayes: Subjectiuely, and it is both the natures of Chriſt,<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 6.33</note> not ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but joyntly together: for there are two parts (or offices) of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe: the firſt in the thinges, that concerne God; the ſecond in the things that concerne vs: and therefore Chriſt muſt bee as a Mediator in office; ſo the middle-one in perſon betweene God and vs, that communicating with both by nature, hee might bee a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betweene both, by office: Secondly, effectually, and they are all actions, which hee performed: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as God; humane, as man; one and indiviſible, as Mediator; whence it is that they are called, Divine-humane, becauſe as there is but one Worker of the Workes of both Natures: ſo is there but one abſolute ending: for the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3172:103"/> working is of the perſon; but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the workings, are of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>The forme is the manner of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring, or the mediation it ſelfe, which of the Schoole-men is vſually conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, eyther in a more large, or in a more ſtrict manner: in that (it is the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which is of Chriſt, as the head of all Angels, and men generally: but in this, it is that, which is of Chriſt, as the Redeemer of men particularly; after which manner, hee is of vs here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>But in this Mediation of Chriſt, the Redeemer, two proportionable things are conſidered; the perſon, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: whence it is, that there is one mediation tearmed Subſtantiall; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by working.</p>
                  <p>The Subſtantiall Mediation, is the conjunct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of the two natures in one perſon, for the worke of mediation.</p>
                  <p>But that, which is by operation, is performed by certaine degrees: the firſt is of an Arbitrator; the ſecond of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3172:103"/> Meſſenger; the third of an Interceſſor; the fourth of ſatisfaction; the laſt, of governing: and all theſe parts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, the Perſon of Chriſt hath, &amp; yet doth execute the properties of both natures wholy kept. For hee is an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator betweene God and Men: a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from the Father with vs: an Interceſſor from vs with the father, who for vs prayeth and maketh ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Prieſt, who for vs offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Laſtly a Governour, who ruleth vs by the vertue and efficacy of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. And of theſe degrees, the firſt &amp; ſecond is of the Propheticall office; the third and fourth, of the Prieſt-hoode; but the laſt, of the kingdome of Chriſt, by his Mediatorſhip.</p>
                  <p>The end of Chriſts office <hi>Supreme,</hi> is the glory of God; <hi>Subordinate,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Iuſtification, and our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>And this is the common way and manner of Chriſts office.</p>
                  <p>The particular maner they diſtinguiſh, and define to bee the ſpeciall kinds and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3172:104"/> partes thereof.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall kindes of Chriſts office are three; according as both the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mans condition without Chriſt, &amp; of the deliverance of him from out of the ſame by Chriſt, as alſo the verity of that annointing, whereof hee is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chriſt, moſt clearely convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.<note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 45.7 Heb. 2.9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of mans condition without Chriſt, there are three, as it were degrees: the firſt of Ignorance; the ſecond of Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or diſorder; the third of guilt from both Mans deliverance from the ſame is performed, according to three contrary degrees, which the office of Chriſt ſealeth vnto vs: for Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> is ſet againſt Ignorance; the kingdome of Chriſt, and the building of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in vs, againſt Inordination; the prieſthood againſt guilt.</p>
                  <p>The ſame doth the verity of Chriſts annointing convince: for looke what was the manner of the three-folde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, propheticall, prieſtly, and kingly, which were wont to be confirmed with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3172:104"/> the outward oyle;<note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 30 23.24. &amp; 28.41.. 1. Sam. 16.14. 1. Kin 19.19.</note> the ſame is alſo the manner of Chriſts office, annointed of the Father; both as touching thoſe callings, and as touching the conferring of gifts in them.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a threefold office of Chriſt the Mediator; of propheſie, whereby hee teacheth vs our owne ill, &amp; the good of divine grace;<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> of Prieſt, whereby hee redeemeth vs from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and prepareth for vs divine grace:<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 110 4.

                  <p>And theſe three offices Chriſt hath in order performed, and doth as yet this day performe in Heaven, executing the partes of a Mediator in their order, towardes vs, and towardes God the Father: towardes vs, teaching, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and ruling by the power of his Spirite: towardes the Father, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his meſſage, and the offering vp of himſelfe; yea and moreover, moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully exerciſing his kingly authority, given him of the Father.</p>

                  <p>The Propheticall Office of Chriſt, is a function of the perſon, whereby he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and inſtructeth his church.</p>
                  <p>The verity of this office, is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the partes, and maners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: the partes are two; the outward publiſhing, and the inward illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or efficacy of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The outward publiſhing of doctrine is both the preaching of the Goſpell, concerning the Grace of God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind: as alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Law, according to the mind of the Law-giver himſelf; and laſtly, the fore-telling, and propheſie of things to come.<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 1.13 Mat 5.17.

                  <p>The Immediate is, whereby Chriſt according to his divine Nature of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, inſtructed the Patriarkes and Prophets in the olde Teſtament, by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, oracles, and dreames: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both natures; hee witting and willing taught mankind in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, by outward voyce:<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 11 2.

                  <p>Now commeth the thirde action of Prieſthoode; to witte, Interceſſion: whereof there were, as it were, three partes; Preſentation, whereby the Prieſt preſented himſelfe, as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to God for the people. Covenant, whereby, for himſelfe and the people, hee ſolemnely promiſed thankefulneſſe, and obedience. Prayer, whereby hee prayed for the remiſſion both of his, &amp; their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>And this is the manner of the type, to which the verity of Chriſtes Prieſtly office every way anſwereth moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably and perfectly; whether you reſpect the calling of the perſon, or the execution of his office.</p>
                  <p>The calling of Chriſtes perſon to this prieſtly office, three arguments doe proue: Firſt, divine teſtification, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Author of the Epiſtle to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3172:107"/> Hebrewes, citeth a two-folde teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 5.5 6.</note> Secondly, the voluntary debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts perſon, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his office; whereof there was one onely end, even the execution of this office: Thirdly, the Analogy, and compariſon of Chriſts perſon and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> which the author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes doth at large proſecute.</p>
                  <p>The execution of Chriſts prieſtly office is, as it were, by three partes finiſhed: by the fulfilling of the Law; by the full payment of puniſhment, and by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or by the gracious and effectual application of both.</p>
                  <p>The fulfilling of the Law is that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee hath freely and perfectly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the whole righteouſneſſe, vnto which wee were bound, both by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformity of vnderſtanding, &amp; wil with that Law; and by workes agreeing with this Law, as being perfect, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward.<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.4 Ioh. 17.19 Mat 3.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For two thinges were required, that the Law might bee fulfilled, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the perſon, or that which is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3172:108"/> habituall; and the righteouſneſſe of operation, or that which is actuall: that, from which is the power; this, from which is the Act of fulfilling: Chriſt had both, not for himſelfe onely, but for vs: yet for himſelfe, becauſe man; but for vs, becauſe hee was man for vs: for, as he was made God-man for our ſake; ſo thoſe things which he, beeing man, had and did; he had and did them for vs. Hence it is alſo, that many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led juſt by his obedience, and that hee is ſayde to bee the end of the Law vnto righteouſneſſe, to every one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The full payment of puniſhment is the voluntary oblation of Chriſt, whereby hee offered himſelfe to God, and the Father in the eternall Spirite, the price of Redemption for our ſinnes, being himſelfe, both the Sacrifice, and the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>There were of that oblation, as it were, two partes: the appointing of the Sacrifice; and as it were, the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame for the ſacrificing; then
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3172:108"/> the very conſummation of the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Altar of the croſſe.</p>
                  <p>The appointing and preparing of the Sacrifice, all thoſe ſufferings doe limite, wherewith Chriſt diſpoſed himſelfe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily vnto the oblation of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his body; eſpecially, about the end of his life, and the next day before his death.<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 26.38. Ioh. 12 27 Mar. 4.35</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe ſufferings, ſome were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in reſpect of the ſoule, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 5.7. Apoc. 9.15. Eſa. 53.5.</note> ſome outward, in reſpect of the body:<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 10.5 Mat. 20.28.</note> for the whole Subſtance of his Man-hood muſt needes haue beene poſſeſſed in ſuffering of puniſhments, that hee might ſaue whole man.</p>
                  <p>The conſummation of the oblation was made on the croſſe by death: but, becauſe the Scripture maketh mention of a two-fold death; to wit; naturall, which is of this world; and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which is of the other; both which were layde vpon <hi>Adam</hi> the offender, and his poſterity, when the Lord ſayde, By dying, thou ſhalt die: both theſe Chriſt for vs ſuffered, and ſubdued; that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3172:109"/> when the ſoule was ſeparated from his body:<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 19.30.</note> this, when, having felt by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, the daſhing and violent force thereof, hee ſayde, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 29.46.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Now vnto both deathes was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joyned a curſe corporall, and ſpirituall, by the ſigne of the croſſe, that Chriſt by the curſe of his puniſhment, might purge the curſe of our guilt:<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 3.13 1 Pet. 2.24</note> for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit neyther of both were Infinite, as touching the time: yet both are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Infinite, touching the abſolute quantity: and therefore, Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death infinite in deed, and not in time: becauſe the Infiniteneſſe of his Merite, Satisfaction, Sacrifice, and Redemption, by all meanes went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that Infiniteneſſe of time, which the damned feele.</p>
                  <p>There remayneth the laſt part of the Execution of Chriſts Prieſt. hood, which is Interceſſion: whereby Chriſt apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth effectually that vnto vs, which hee hath deſerved by the fulfilling of the Law, and the full payment of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3172:109"/> Firſt, by preſenting himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to God the Father, as the onely Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Satisfier, that hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto vs the preſentation of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and of his performed ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.24. Rom. 8.34</note> the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of righteouſneſſe: Secondly, by promiſing and vndertaking to God the Father for vs, obedience, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: the ſeale and earneſt of which vndertaking, hee giveth vs, even his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, by whome hee might ſtirre vp in vs a deſire, both to avoyde ſinne, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme righteouſneſſe.<note n="r" place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>And this interceſſion of Chriſt, as it leaneth vpon his ſatisfaction and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: ſo it obtayneth that dignity &amp; value which it hath from his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe worke it is.</p>
                  <p>The kingly office of Chriſt, is that whereby Chriſt doth order, and deſend his kingdome purchaſed by Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But whereas, the kingdome of Chriſt is two-fold, the one Eſſentiall,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3172:110"/> according to nature, which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt: the other Perſonall, according to diſpenſation of will, which hee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth, as being Mediator:<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 18 36. Rom. 14.17. Pſal. 2.6. Eph. 1.22.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this properly; this Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, muſt needes bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Now it is conſidered by the manner of adminiſtration, and the tearme, or end thereof.</p>
                  <p>Of Adminiſtration, there are two times: the preſent, as of this world, &amp; the future, as of the other.</p>
                  <p>In this world Chriſt adminiſtreth, or ordayneth his church two wayes: by Preſcription, and by Execution of Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The Preſcription of Lawes is two-fold: outward, whereby Chriſt by the Miniſtery of the Word, preſcribeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Subjects, Lawes of<note n="u" place="margin">Iac. 4.12 Eph. 4.11. 1. Cor. 12.18.</note> beleeving, and living. Inward, whereby, he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by his holy ſpirite, the hearts of the Elect vnto the obedience of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, with a feeling of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  </p>
                  <p>The Execution is finiſhed in two partes: In the gracious diſtribution of Rewardes and Benefites, whereby all corporall, and ſpirituall things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſalvation, are miniſtred to the church, vnder a certaine condition of the croſſe:<note n="y" place="margin">Ioh. 14 18.

                  </p>

                  <p>The terme and end of this kingdome, in reſpect of<note n="d" place="margin">Oecono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miae.</note> the ordering thereof, ſhal bee, when the Sonne, being about to deliver vp this kingdome of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, to God, and the Father; ſhall be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3172:111"/> ſubject vnto him, who hath made all things ſubject to himſelfe, that GOD may bee all in all:<note n="e" place="margin">1.

                  <p>And this is the manner of Chriſts Office, according to the ſpeciall kinds thereof. Now concerning the parts, wee muſt in few wordes conſider: Of Chriſts Office, there are two parts: or (as they are commonly called,) two Eſtates of Chriſt, God-man: Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and Exaltation: for in theſe, that whole diſpenſation of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the execution of Chriſtes threefold Office conſiſteth: wherefore, looke what is the manner of Chriſtes Office from the Natures in the perſon, or from the perſon, according to both Natures, the ſame alſo, is the manner of his Humiliation, and Exaltation.</p>
                  <p>Humiliation is that baſe, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3172:111"/> condition of Chriſt, God-man vpon earth; whereby hee debaſed himſelfe, as touching both Natures, that he might both die, and by dying ſatiſfie: as touching his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he debaſed himſelfe, both by a voluntary ſubjection of his Perſon, and by a hiding of his glory, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty before men, for the time:<note n="f" place="margin">Phi. 2.7.8</note> as touching his Humane Nature, both by taking vnto him the Infirmity of our Nature; and ſecondly, by his moſt humble Obedience of Life, and Death.<note n="g" place="margin">Eſa. 53.5 Ioh. 19.34</note>.</p>
                  <p>Exaltation is the condition of Chriſt, God-man, whereby hee was advanced into the glory and dignity, which was meete, or convenient for the perſon of a Mediator, and that according to both natures; according to the divine nature by relation, or by a divine manifeſtation of that maieſty which he hid, during the time of his abaſement;<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 1.4 Act. 2.38.</note> according to the humane; partly, by the depoſition of his ſervile conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and partly by the receiving gifts, in body &amp; in ſoule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3172:112"/> together vnto the perfection and bleſſedneſſe of his humane nature, aboue all nature.<note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 3.21 Ephe. 1.20 2. Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of both ſtates, there are proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, oppoſite one to the other. Of Humiliation; and firſt of that which is outwarde, or of his Submiſſion vnto death, there are three degrees: death, with the curſe conjoyned:<note n="k" place="margin">Gal 3.13.</note> Burial, that the truth of his death might bee ratified:<note n="l" place="margin">Luc. 23 53.</note> Deſcent into Hell, or that voluntary debaſement of Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and as it were, with wreſtling, to overcome the paines of Hell, which Chriſt chiefly felt in his ſoule, when he was aſſaulted; firſt with heavineſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes with the ſorrowes of both deaths.<note n="m" place="margin">Act. 2.24. Eph. 4.4</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe are oppoſed three degrees of Exaltation: Reſurrection, in which by divine power, having ſubdued death, hee rayſed vp himſelfe vnto life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 28.6. 1 Cor 13.4.</note>

                  <p>Now the verity of this Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought three wayes ſeverally to bee marked: by the degrees thereof; by the outward meanes, and by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: the degrees, according to which, God in time applyeth vnto vs the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Redemption, are chiefly two: Vocation, and Iuſtification.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:3172:116"/>
                  <p>Vocation, is the firſt degree of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, on Gods behalfe; called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Augustine,</hi> The entry vnto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the firſt paſſage towardes the end.</p>
                  <p>Of this Vocation, there is vſually had a divers knowledge, according as it is diſtinguiſhed; eyther, as touching the manner of calling, into an Inward, and outward: or as touching the divers condition of the cauſe Efficient, into a Generall, and Particular: or Laſtly, as touching the effect of calling, vnto an Effectuall, and not Effectuall Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Now of this Vocation, whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Particular, and Effectuall; or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, generall, and ineffectuall, there is a double reſpect: the one Abſolute in it ſelfe; the other Ioynt, (or conjoyned) in an ordinary vocation. For God calleth outwardly in generall; inwardly, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and joyntly, both wayes ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                  <p>Of both, we are orderly to treate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of the cauſes.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:3172:117"/>
                  <p>The outward and generall Vocation, (that wee may ſpeake of it in the firſt place) is a gracious action of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he calleth men forth, by word, ſigne, and worke, from vnbeliefe vnto faith; that both the faithfull might bee diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the communion of ſalvation, and that others being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced of the grace offered vnto them by God, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inexcuſable.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe Efficient of this Vocation is God, becauſe it is from him properly, if you marke the true beginning therof; and is from him, firſt, (or chiefly,) by himſelfe, and principally, if you haue a reſpect vnto the meanes, which God would haue to be vſed, eyther extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, or ordinarily, for the calling of men.</p>
                  <p>The beginning is that loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, wherby as a lover of ſoules, and the Saviour of Men,<note n="a" place="margin">Sap. 11.27. 1 Tim. 4.10.</note> hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his good will towardes all men, and generally offereth his Grace vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Now, hee offereth the ſame (that wee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3172:117"/> may in few wordes ſpeake of the means) by word, by ſignes, and by workes; all which in reſpect of God, that ordayneth them, are generall: by word, eyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, ſuch as was in the firſt times of the Church;<note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 12.8.

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:3172:119"/>
                  <p>Of this Information, there are two partes; the one is, that effectuall action of Gods Spirite in vs, and according to that the whole renuing of man, which in the Scripture is commonly called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:<note n="p" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.9.

                  <p>And this is the maner of the outward and inward abſolute calling: whereof the one is of good pleaſure, and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the other of the ſigne: the one of Efficacy, the other of Signification, tending to Efficacy: the one proper to the Elect, the other common to all.</p>

                  <p>The Efficient cauſe of this calling, is God: for the calling is of gift, not of merite: of grace, not of nature: God calling whome hee will; and againe, whome hee will; eyther not calling at all, or not effectually calling; but both freely without reſpect of perſon, or without blame.</p>
                  <p>The matter are men elect, in whom alone, onely this calling is effectuall, perticularly, and ſavingly; though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the not elected, and Hypocrites may both receyue the vſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling, and ſeeme openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſence (and feeling) of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: whence it is, that the Effect of the calling, of theſe is called in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 6.5</note> taſte onely, but of thoſe a commixture of the Word with faith.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note>

                  <p>THe Second degree of Application which is here made on the behalf of God, is Iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>It is needefull that the verity of this Iuſtification bee declared two wayes: by Anotation of Words, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3172:123"/> there is vſe in the explication of this doctrine: as alſo by definition of the thing it ſelfe, according to all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>The Words, whoſe doubtfull ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is to bee taken away, leſt they ſhould in the doctrine it ſelfe breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulty, are chiefly two; Iuſtice, and Iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>Iuſtice, (which indeede is of the Perſon) is two wayes vſually conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: one way, in the manner of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Inherence; and it is the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law, which wee performe to it: the other, in manner of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Imputation; and it is a gracious giving of another mans obedience for vs performed: that, is called the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the law, or Works: this, of the Goſpell, or Faith: that, is in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubjectiuely; this, of the Perſon by Grace of Imputation. It is needefull, that both bee diſtinguiſhed, becauſe there is a diverſe vſe of both; of this, in the Private, and inward court of the conſcience before God: of that, in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3172:124"/> publicke, and outward Court of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſion before men.</p>
                  <p>Iuſtification generally conſidered, is the very application of righteouſnes: but ſpecially, if wee treate of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe inherent, it is the effecting of a certaine habituall holines in man, which ſignification is moſt vnuſuall, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper: if wee treate of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Imputation; it is a gracious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of another mans righteouſnes by faith; and ſo an abſolving of a man before God.</p>
                  <p>And this ſignification, as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and vſuall, both the common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of tonges,<note n="a" place="margin">Idiotiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> &amp; the proper phraſe of the holy Scriptures doe confirme.</p>
                  <p>The common cuſtome of tongues; for as with the Grecians, to juſtifie hath two ſignifications, beſides (or without) the doctrine of Iuſtification; the one, to judge and pronounce one juſt, by publicke judgement: the other, after the cauſe is judged, judiciouſly to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one: ſo, that there is the ſame vſe of the word with the Hebrewes; two
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3172:124"/> things doe moſt evidently proue: firſt, the direct and moſt frequent vſe of that word in court, or pubilcke judgements, cauſes, and actions<note n="b" place="margin">2.

                  <p>And in this ſignification the word to Iuſtifie, commonly importeth three thinges. To abſolue a perſon accuſed;<note n="e" place="margin">Eſa 5.23 Exod. 23. Luc. 7.29.</note> to iudge one for righteous: to giue a teſtimony to one already Iuſtified; as alſo rewardes, which are due to the iuſt and innocent.</p>
                  <p>If you reſpect the proper phraſe of the Scripture by iudiciall proceeding, it propoſeth the whole doctrine of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: this the Phraſes of ſpeaking, which the Scripture vſeth; as alſo that whole manner and courſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it deſcribeth, doe proue.</p>
                  <p>The Phraſes, which in this point the Scripture vſeth, do proue; ſome by way of deniall, that, hee which is iuſtified, is not condemned, not iudged: and that ſinnes are not imputed vnto him: <hi rend="sup">f</hi> ſome by way of affirmation doe proue, that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3172:125"/> hee is made iuſt, is freede from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and condemnation of the law, that righteouſneſſe is imputed vnto him. &amp;c.<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5.18. &amp; 8.33</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole courſe and manner of our Salvation is fully performed, as it were, by two degrees: by the knowledge of our miſery, and the truſt of Gods mercy. Of our miſery, there are three partes: the Offence, the Guilt, and the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of Gods mercy, there are three oppoſite parts; the foregiueneſſe of the fault, the abſolving from the guilt, and the freeing from the puniſhment. That whole courſe or proceeding, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to Gods mercy, is caled Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a ſignification taken from common pleadings:<note n="h" place="margin">Forenſi.</note> or from the Lawyers.</p>
                  <p>Iuſtification therefore is properly a free iudiciall action of God, whereby hee iudgeth the elect in themſelues ſubiect to the accuſation and maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, to bee iuſt by faith, through Chriſt by imputation of his righteouſneſſe, vnto the prayſe of the glory of his Grace, and their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 3.24.25.</note>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:3172:125"/>
                  <p>That this definition might be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtoode, it is needefull that the Cauſes, which are orderly noted in the ſame, bee two wayes conſidered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Iuſtification is taken, eyther Actiuely, in reſpect of God, who iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth; or Paſſiuely, in reſpect of man, who is iuſtified.</p>
                  <p>The Efficient cauſe of Iuſtification, taken actiuely, is God the Father, in the Sonne, by the holy Ghoſt:<note n="k" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19. 2. Cor. 6.21.</note> for it is in him to abſolue (or acquite) the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſon, by whoſe Iuſtice hee is made guilty: in him to pronounce one iuſt, whoſe will is a rule of Iuſtice: Laſtly, in him to giue iudgement of life or death, who by nature, right, and office, is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme iudge.<note n="l" place="margin">Eſa. 59 1 Pſal. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this Efficient, there is a double Impulſiue cauſe; Outward, and Inward: the Inward, is the onely mercy of the father,<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 3.23.</note> both in regard of his good ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which predeſtinated vs<note n="n" place="margin">Ephe. 1.5</note> into the adoption of ſonnes,<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 3.23.</note> as alſo in regard of the<note n="p" place="margin">Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae.</note> diſpoſing, and diſpenſation,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3172:126"/> which both ordained the Sonne for this end, and applyed the benefite obtayne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by the Sonne vnto vs<note n="q" place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.12.</note>. And this is the grace, which in Scripture if called the Grace of <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Free gifts; in Schooles, the Grace that maketh one acceptable; and among the common ſort, the Grace that freely giveth, and is alwayes oppoſed vnto workes, which are called the gifts by grace, or of grace freely give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; becauſe God tooke not the firſt cauſe of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from vs, or our workes: but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and from himſelfe, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of the glory of his grace.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, there can bee from vs no diſpoſition, and preparation, which of the Popelings is ſurmiſed to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the bringing in of the forme of Iuſtification<note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 2.8.9. Tit. 3.5.

                  <p>The outward impulſiue cauſe is Chriſt, God-man, both in reſpect of his merit, as alſo of his efficacy and operation.</p>
                  <p>Of his merite, becauſe both by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering in his life and death, he purchaſed for vs the benefite of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.<note n="t" place="margin">Eſa. 83.3. 1. Tim. 2.6. 1. Ioh 1.7 Rom. 8.30 31.</note>

                  <p>The matter of Iuſtification, which on Gods behalfe is conſidered actiuely, is two fold, according as there are two parts of Iuſtificatjon; the Remiſſion of ſinnes, and the obedjence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For, becauſe we<note n="y" place="margin">Aſiequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſumus.</note> procured vnto our ſelues both the bond of death, and the deprjuation of righteouſneſſe, and life, both were needful for our Iuſtificatjon, that both our ſinne might bee aboliſhed by Remiſſion, that wee might be freed from death, which is the wages of ſinne, and that righteouſneſſe might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto vs, to the end we might attaine vnto life<note n="z" place="margin">Dan. 9.24.

                  <p>By the name of Remiſſion of ſinnes, we vnderſtand that gratious act of God,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3172:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> whereby hee perfectly forgiueth and remitteth the fault, and the puniſhment, for the merit and ſatisfaction of Chriſt:<note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19. Rom. 8.1. &amp; 4.7.</note> The foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, not his Eſſentiall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,<note n="b" place="margin">Eſa. 42.8</note> nor yet his habituall, which was his originall righteouſneſſe oppoſite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our originall righteouſneſſe, or ſpot of nature; but his actuall righteouſneſſe, which is the effect of both: namely a moſt perfect obedience, performed to the Father, both by ſatisfaction for ſin, and by fulfilling of the Law. For the obedience of Chriſt is two fold; oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the double bond of man after his fall; actiue, for the fault; paſſiue, for the puniſhment: or both, for both.</p>
                  <p>The Actiue obedience is a perfect performance of Gods law, which Chriſt fully and perfectly executed even to the vtmoſt title<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30. Rom 5.19 2. Cor. 5.21.</note> of the law: the neceſſitie hereof, in the worke of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Iuſtification, three things doe prooue: the Iuſtice of God, the office of a Mediatour, and our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The iuſtice of God: for if you eyther
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3172:128"/> reſpect his nature, wherby he is infinitly iuſt, he ought not to ſaue man, but by the ſame manner of iuſtice<note n="d" place="margin">Prou 17 Exod. 20.5</note>; eyther proper to vs, or freely imputed; or (if we reſpect) his will revealed in the law, which is an vnmoueable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Iuſtice, he hath preſcribed none other way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, than obedience.</p>
                  <p>The office of Chriſt the Mediatour: for, wheras he, as our ſurety was bound, by a voluntary diſpenſation, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and performe thoſe things, which we our ſelues were neceſſarily bound to vndergoe and performe; it was needfull that he ſhould not onely ſuffer death for vs, but alſo performe the law, becauſe we were bound vnto both<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8.3 Gal. 4 45.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Our Saluation: for, whereas two things are neceſſary for the ſame, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from death, and a giuing of life; it was needfull, we ſhould obtaine the one by the purging of ſinne, and the other by the gift of righteouſneſſe<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 10 4 Rom. 5 19 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that Chriſt is ſaid to be the end, and preſection of the law vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to every one that beleeveth; and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3172:128"/> the actuall obedience of Chriſt, whereby we are made juſt, is in the Scripture, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the actual diſobedience of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> whereby wee are made ſinners<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.

                  <p>Adde further, that in the very paſſiue obedience, the actiue nevertheleſſe doth of right challenge vnto it ſelfe the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the ſuffering doth not ſimply ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, but as it is the ſuffering of Chriſt voluntarily preſenting himſelfe to God the Father, by his Eternall Spirit: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the ſame Chriſt, by offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as a ſacrifice ſuffered; as a Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer performed it.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſiue obedience of Chriſt, is the ſacrificing, or ſuffering of Chriſt; very neceſſary in reſpect of God, of Chriſt the Mediator, and of vs. Of God, becauſe his juſtice muſt haue beene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by puniſhment. Of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, being our ſurety, ought to haue payde our debt. Of vs, becauſe it was needefull, that we ſhould be freed from death by death<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 8.33.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Subiect of this righteouſneſſe, is Chriſt alone, in whom ſubiectiuely that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3172:129"/> habituall Iuſtice is inherent, and from whom, that both actiue, &amp; paſſiue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience proceeded, which wee called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The matter of Iuſtification, which is conſidered Paſſiuely, are men elect;<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 5.8 10. Tit. 3.3. Eph. 2.12.13.</note> Of this matter, there is commonly had a double notion; the one according to Nature; the other, according to Grace ſupernaturall; according to nature, they are ſinners, and therefore ſubiect to the accuſation and malediction of the law:<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8.30. Eph. 5.30. Ioh. 17 20.</note> according to grace ſupernatural, they are beleevers, or ingraffed by faith into Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The forme of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, taken actiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a feee imputation of Chriſts actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſſe, whereby the merits and obedience of Chriſt are applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by vertue of that moſt ſtrait com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whereby hee is in vs, and we in him.</p>
                  <p>The forme therfore conſiſteth in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; in which the vnity that ariſeth thereout, hath between both boundes, the manner of a forme: and conſiſteth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3172:129"/> rather in the iſſuing forth, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, then in the inherence. Hence it is alſo, that Relation is ſayde<note n="m" place="margin">Non eſſe eius, ſed eſſe ad ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad.</note> not to bee his, but to be in reſpect of another. Now, it is receyved by right of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and acceptance of the merites of Chriſtes obedience: for this imputed righteouſneſſe is grace, and not nature; the communicating of a benefite, not a Real, or habitual poſſeſſion of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or ſubſtance of Chriſt: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an Imputation, not a paſſible quality inherent in vs.</p>
                  <p>In this Imputation we conſider two things: the truth thereof in it ſelfe, and the manner of the truth thereof in vs.</p>
                  <p>Of the truth in it ſelfe there are two bounds, Righteouſneſſe, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation thereof: between theſe there is a relation, becauſe Chriſt hath perfect righteouſnes, for no other end, then that hee might impute it; nor imputeth any other thing then righteouſneſſe; nor is our righteouſneſſe any otherwiſe then by Imputation.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the truth thereof in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3172:130"/> vs, is in the Scripture two wayes limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: whereof, the former teacheth vs, that wee are iuſt, not in our ſelues, not in our owne righteouſneſſe; but by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which being out of vs, is made ours, by right of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Hence wee are ſayde to be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him<note n="n" place="margin">Cot. 5.21.</note>: the ſecond teacheth vs, that we haue righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as Chriſt hath our ſinne: now he hath it, not ſubiectiuely, or inherent, but by imputation. Hence is that<note n="o" place="margin">Autithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made by the Apoſtle in the place already cited, to wit, of Chriſt, whome God made ſinne for vs; and of vs, who were made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</p>
                  <p>And according to this forme of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; there is one and alike Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all men, though in diverſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of him that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, it be after a divers maner mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified.</p>

Laſtly, in the ſcope and end, (for they tend to one end, ſaue that the one is as the cauſe, the other, as the way,) yet they much differ, both as touching the ſubſtance, and as touching the Adiuncts.</p>
                  <p>As touching the ſubſtance; that is, as touching all the cauſes: for the matter of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is the obedience of Chriſt; of Sanctification, our owne obedience; the one perfect, the other vnperfect; the forme thereof that, is the Imputation of Chriſts obedience; but of this, the drawing backe of our minds from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, to pure qualities. Of Iuſtification, there is no neereſt, and inward efficient cauſe; but of this (Sanctification) the wil of man is, being the beginning of human actions: the end of that is the peace of conſcience; but of this, an open teſtifying of the reconciling of our ſelues with God.</p>

                  <p>As touching the Adiuncts; becauſe they differ, firſt in the maner of effecting; for that is effected by right of donation; this by maner of alteration: ſecondly by the Effects: that abſolveth vs in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, This doth not. Thirdly, and laſtly, in continuance; for, That ſhall haue an end with this life; This ſhall endure for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Forme of Iuſtification, taken paſſiuely, is the application of Faith. Hence it is, that wee are ſayde to bee ſaved<note n="p" place="margin">Per fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fide, ex fide.</note> by faith, through faith, of faith; of which wee haue ſpoken in the cauſe Inſtrumentall<note n="q" place="margin">Mar. 5.39.

                     <p>The firſt is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Of which wee haue treated in the explication of thoſe places, which were alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true nature of the name, or word.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Anſw. Firſt, the Grace of God is taken in Scripture aequivocally: Firſt, for the free and eternall favour of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee made vs acceptable to him ſelfe, in his beloved Sonne: and this is the Grace that maketh acceptable. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the giftes, by Grace, whether outward, or inward, whether generall, or particula; and that, in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is taken in that ſignification, and not in this, three thinges doe proue. Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle excludeth the righteouſneſſe of the law, which is of works; to the end hee might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the righteouſneſſe of faith, the cauſes whereof, hee reckoneth vp. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe, what hee called free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee expounded by grace, that not onely the workes that goe before; but alſo thoſe that follow, after faith might
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3172:143"/> bee excluded. Thirdly, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle oppoſeth the very ſame Grace, <hi>cap.</hi> 4.2.4. againſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, howſoever proceeding from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the Spirite. Secondly, neyther in deed, doth the conjoyning of thoſe two words, <hi>Freely,</hi> and <hi>by Grace;</hi> (ſith the one expoundeth the other accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripturall Phraſe of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:) nor doth the force of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>(by,)</hi> which is not found in the originall Text, and very often in the Scripture, noteth the efficient; nor doth the Efficacy of Gods grace, the effect whereof ought neceſſarily to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Cauſe: nor laſtly doth it, becauſe loue in Scripture is called any Grace (whereas both the loue of God towards vs, is a grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king acceptable, and ours towardes God is a grace freely given,) any way infringe that interpretation.</p>
                     <p>The third, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. To this wee haue aboue anſwered.</p>
                     <p>The fourth. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. Anſw. Firſt, the Effect is badly confounded with the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3172:144"/> cauſe, to witte; Iuſtification, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and Renovation; for the matter of that, is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; but of this, our Inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Secondly, neyther doth the Apoſtle call Renovation, Iuſtification; ſith hee expreſly diſtinguiſheth the one from the other. Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſheweth not the cauſe, but the vſe of Renovation, or good workes, when he ſayeth; that being juſtified by the grace of God, wee might bee heyres, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hope of everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>The fift, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: Anſ. Firſt, there is a two-folde righteouſneſſe, Imputed, and Inherent: by both they are called Iuſt, (or righteous) but after a divers manner: by that, by way of Relation, and perfectly before God: by this, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choatiuely, Subjectiuely and vnperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, the perfection, which is aſcribed vnto the faithfull, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath a three-fold reſpect; the firſt, of Gods councell from everlaſting: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the foundation in Chriſt; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eyther of compariſon, and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3172:144"/> vnto other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnrighteouſnes, or of the end, or tearme of perfection, vnto which it tendeth: beſides theſe reſpects, there is no perfection of the faithfull in this world. Thirdly, the neareſt cauſe, in deede of a righteous worke, is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe; but the chiefe, and principall cauſe, is the Spirit of Chriſt; imputing his righteouſnes to vs, and by the power of that imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, working this inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in vs.</p>
                     <p>The Sixt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Anſ. firſt, our Conformity with the Image of Chriſt, whereof mention is made in the Scripture, is threefold: the one, vnto the image of glory, being oppoſite to that, which is vnto the image of Chriſts afflictions: And of this the Apoſtle treateth in the cited places. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, vnto the image of Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which, in deede, in this world, we performe vnperfectly: but Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the ſame to vs, as perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for vs. The third, is of the death, buriall, and reſurrection of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3172:145"/> of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, there is a double vſe: the one principall of ſatisfaction, and merite: the other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, and of document: as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction, Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed to vs; as touching example, it is the rule of our inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Thirdly, the oppoſition, which is made betweene the image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, in both places, hath reſpect vnto the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and immortality, the earthly, and heavenly qualities of the body; &amp; not properly vnto ſinne, and Chriſts impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaventh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Anſ. The word Iuſtification is taken two wayes; properly, and improperly: Properly, when wee are ſayde to bee juſtified by the cauſe; Improperly, when wee are ſayde to bee juſtified by the effects. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Apoſtle treateth of our Sanctification, and the two parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the mortifying of the old man, and the quickning of the new of both which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3172:145"/> partes, hee giues vs an example in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The eight, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. Anſwere: Firſt, the degrees of our Salvation, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Iuſtification, are badly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together. Secondly, of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are two conſiderations; the one, according to the truth, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof, in the eternall counſell of our Election: the other, according to the fruition, and accompliſhment thereof in the other life. In that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, Adoption goeth before Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: but in thi, Adoption is the bound, and end of Iuſtification. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is one thing to call Iuſtification Putatiue, and another Imputatiue: that, as being falſe, is falſely alſo faigned vnto vs: this, is no leſſe true, then if we our ſelues had it ſubiectiuely, becauſe of the truths ſake, both of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,

Or whether you reſpect our Salvation, it was behouefull alſo, that the two parts of Iuſtification ſhould bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a double evill, wherevnto wee were ſubiect: to puniſhment, remiſſion of ſinnes, to offence, imputation of righteouſneſſe. Or laſtly, whether you reſpect the ſatisfaction of the Law, two things were neceſſary; the firſt, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3172:147"/> wee might bee freed from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the law threatneth: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee might fulfill the law, and ſo might bee made like vnto Chriſt.

                  <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> of adminiſtring this covenant was divers, according to the difference of the times<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 1.1</note>; wherein a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe face, and forme was put vpon that ſelfe ſame ſubſtance of the thing.</p>

                  <p>And that wee may ſpeake of the firſt, euen before Chriſtes comming; he adminiſtred this covenant diverſe wayes, according to the manner of the three Ages.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Age was from the time of <hi>Adams</hi> fall vnto <hi>Abraham;</hi> at which

                  <p>And this was the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond was from <hi>Abraham</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the promiſe which hithervnto was propoſed vnto all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrayned to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, was ſealed with Sacraments, &amp;, after that a ſolemne covenant was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the promiſe; conditions were layed downe on both ſides, aſwell on Gods behalfe, as on mans behalfe.</p>
                  <p>And this is properly called the <hi>Manner of the Covenant,</hi> becauſe of the expreſſe mention of the mutuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 7 4 5. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The third, was from <hi>Moſes</hi> vnto Chriſts comming, when God, in a more ſpeciall manner diſpoſed, declared, and confirmed that covenant, into the forme of a Teſtament<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 9 15 16.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>Testament,</hi> there are two partes ſubordinate, the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3172:153"/> The one <hi>Legall</hi> and conditionall, requiting of man a perfect obedience of the law, and vnder condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, promiſing life eternall<note n="o" place="margin">Leu. 18.5.

                  <p>And this was the Maner of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the covenant before Chriſtes comming.</p>

                  <p>We ſay abrogated after a ſort, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of both partes of the Teſtament; of the former, becauſe God neyther vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, nor requireth the manner of

                  <p>Of theſe wee vſually, and duely holde and expound a two-fold manner; the one <hi>Generall,</hi> concerning all; the other, <hi>Speciall,</hi> concerning each one of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Now by the Name of <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which is tranſlated from military affaires, to Chriſtian vſes) wee doe not in the largeſt ſignification, by a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis, vnderſtand every myſtery, or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſecret of a holy and divine thing, in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3172:158"/> which ſence the Goſpell, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, are wont to bee expounded in Scriptures: Neyther in a leſſe generall ſignification, by a <hi>Catechreſis,</hi> doe wee vnderſtand a divine myſtery, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Symbolicall ſecret, or every ſuch thing, as ſignifieth ſomewhat elſe, beſide the ſhew, which is offered vnto the ſenſes; ſuch as are Ceremonies, Types, Parables, Signes, and Figures: all which, becauſe they pertaine to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, were called of the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Sacraments: but in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and moſt proper ſignification, by the name of Sacrament, wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a Signe of Grace, ordayned of God, that hee might both ſeale vp his benefits in vs, and conſecrate vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for ever; for in the ſignification of Sacrament, there is a mutuall reſpect: the one on Gods behalfe offering grace; the other on mans behalfe, promiſing thankefulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſence, is the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament wont to bee vſed two manner
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3172:159"/> of wayes: eyther for the ſigne onely, &amp; the thing ſignified Synecdochically: or properly, for both; or for that whole holy action, which commeth together, for the full participation of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Now Sacraments are called Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not for that they bee the working of miracles, but the ceremonies of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſpirituall thing: or (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> ſpeaketh) becauſe they are the Signes of thinges, being one thing, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying another thing; whence it is, that they were alſo called<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Now a Sacrament is a holy action, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of God; whereby God, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his promiſe; ſealeth vp his grace in Chriſt, with a fitte agreement of the ſignes, and the things ſignified<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 4.11. 1.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3172:159"/> divine majeſty, which onely hath right to promiſe the thing ſignified, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to apply the ſame: whence ſprung that immoueable, and golden rule; <hi>that nothing hath the Nature of a Sacrament,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now God effecteth a Sacrament by the word of Inſtitution, which added vnto the Element, it becommeth, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament not by infuſion of a new quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but by changing of the vſe.</p>
                  <p>Of this Word called Sacramentall, there are two partes, a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a promiſe: whereof the one ſheweth the authority of the ſacrament; the other, the vſe and efficacy of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Commaundement,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God commaundeth, both that the Sacraments ſhould be adminiſtred, by preſcribing the forme of them; as alſo, that they be receyved, by giving charge for the vſe thereof: ſo in the Supper, the forme of Inſtitution is preſcribed, and the vſe of the Supper is given in charge: the ſame in Baptiſme alſo.<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 28 19.

                  <p>The <hi>Promiſe</hi> annexed to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, as it were, the power, and life of the Sacrament, which the Effect neceſſarily followeth<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 26.26 1. Cor. 11.24. Rom. 6. 2. Pet. 3.</note>: ſo in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there is promiſe made of the eternal and ſpirituall nouriſhment of the ſoule; in Baptiſme, of the ſalvation of the ſouls, and the waſhing away of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>And the conſideration of this Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, doth circumſcribe the whole dignity of a Sacrament: wherefore it cannot be, that the ſame is eyther<note n="f" place="margin">Tit. 1.25 Eph. 3 17</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated through the faultes of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; or<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3.3.4</note> that any thing is detracted from it, becauſe of their vnbeliefe, which receiue but the ſignes onely.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Sacraments, is two-fold: the one ſenſible, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other intelligible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: of theſe, the one is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Signe; the other, the thing ſignified, or the thing of the ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Now, by the name of Signe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, we vnderſtand every thing, the vſe whereof is put in ſignifying: in which ſignification, there are two ſorts
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3172:160"/> of ſignes; ſome by <hi>Augustine,</hi> called Naturall, and ſome Given: Naturall are thoſe, which without will, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſignifie, doe cauſe ſomewhat elſe, beſide themſelues, by themſelues to be knowne, as the dawning, is a ſign of the Sunne to be neare at hand, and the ſmoake of the fire. Given are thoſe, which depend on the Will of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor, whether God or Man: for the ſignes, which are of force, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Will, are eyther of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or divine Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, which are of divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (of which onely our ſpeech is in this place,) are ſome miraculous; ſome without miracle: thoſe haue reſpect vnto the extraordinary, and vnuſuall works of God, at which, the minds of men are greatly aſtoniſhed; of which ſort, very many ſignes, eyther of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine, or wrath, or grace, doe occurre in Scriptures: theſe are fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and favourable ſignes of Gods grace, whether they be monuments of things paſt, or whether pointing out or
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3172:161"/> ſigning a thing preſent, or to come: or witneſſing the certainty of a thing, as it were, with a ſealed ſtampe thereon; or laſtly, yeelding that thing, which is ſignified, and that by the verity of Gods inſtitution, and the hidden vertue of the Spirite.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch are theſe Sacramentall Signes, not naturall, but given; that is of God inſtituted, that they might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, ſeale, and exhibite. Of theſe ſignes, two partes ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and declared: the one Elemental, the other, Ceremoniall: whereof the one reſpecteth the Subſtantiall matter, the other, the action, and the Rite.</p>
                  <p>The Subſtantiall matter, is all that in the Sacrament, which is ſet a part from common vſe, by Gods ordinance, and appointed for the ſignifying, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and exhibiting of inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things; ſuch as in Baptiſme, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> becauſe whole Chriſt is given in every Sacrament, both by reaſon of his Divinity, and Humanity, although eſpecially mention bee made, and reſpect had of his Humanity, in the Inſtitution of the Sacrament: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to it, he is of the ſame Eſſence with vs, and our brother; as alſo, for that in it, Chriſt merited that, for vs, which the Sacrament ſealeth: and laſtly in that, an entrance is given medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by it, vnto this Divinity and Gods Grace.</p>

                  <p>From this conſideration of the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, the agreement, and difference of both may bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: The <hi>Difference,</hi> becauſe they are divers, both in nature, (for the Signe is viſible; the thing ſignified is inviſible) and in the <hi>Obiect:</hi> for the ſigne goeth but into the body, the thing ſignified into the ſoule: and in the <hi>Manner</hi> of communication: for in reſpect of the ſigne, the manner is corporall, but of the thing ſignified, it is ſpirituall: the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,</hi> becauſe thoſe things, which were otherwiſe really, and very farre ſeparated, are joyned together by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall vnion.</p>
                  <p>The inward and proper forme of a Sacrament, is that excellent agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Signe, with the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the mutuall relation of the one vnto the other; whereof that, properly conſiſteth in the compariſon and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Effects, &amp; this in the orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſigne to the thing ſignified.</p>

Act. 7.8.</note>: the other, when the thing ſignified, is pronounced of the ſigne; that is, when the very thing ſignified, is ſayde to be the ſigne; as when the bread is called the body of Chriſt, &amp; the wine the bloud of Chriſt<note n="x" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.24. Mat. 26.28</note>.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Predications are wont to bee called <hi>Relatiue, Analogicall,</hi> and <hi>Metonymycall: Relatiue,</hi> becauſe, when the one ſeparated thing, is pronounced of the other; a mutuall relation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:3172:165"/> of things like the one to the other, is neceſſarily preſuppoſed. <hi>Analogical,</hi> becauſe the changing of the names is made, in regard of the Analogy, and exceeding great agreement betweene themſelues. <hi>Metonymycall,</hi> becauſe the ſigne is put for the thing ſignified, &amp; ſo contrariwiſe. The reaſon of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications in the mater of a Sacrament, is the vnion, which as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in three, in the ſignifying, ſealing, and ſpirituall exhibiting; ſo it maketh theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Predications true, becauſe of the ſignifying, ſealing, and exhibiting.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> of a Sacrament is two-fold; Proper and Accidentall: The <hi>Proper,</hi> is eyther Primary, or Secondary: That, is the viſible ſealing of Gods inviſible grace, and our conjunction with Chriſt:<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 6.4. 1. Cor. 10.16. Gal. 3.27.</note> This, is a teſtifying of godlineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of loue towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and of open profeſſion, whereby, as by a marke, wee are ſevered from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synagogues of Sathan<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17. Eph. 4.5 1. Cor. 11.29.</note>. The <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall,</hi> is the condemation of them, that vnworthily communicate: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3172:165"/> the vnfaithfull receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, yet, for the abuſe of the ſignes, &amp; reproachful contempt againſt the thing ſignified, they are made guilty of the contempt of Chriſt, and therefore alſo of everlaſting death and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>By this<note n="a" place="margin">An alyſi.</note> opening of the definition through all the cauſes, it may eaſily be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, what thoſe things are, which moſt properly may hold the name, and nature of a Sacrament; to witte, thoſe wherein there may be a concurrence of all theſe cauſes and of the conditions, that iſſue out of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Such Sacraments as theſe, are ſome of the Old, &amp; ſome of the New Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, which are of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are of two ſorts: for ſome were <hi>Temporary, Accidentall,</hi> and <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> which God vſed but once or for a certaine time: and of theſe, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our Baptiſme, as the paſſage through the red ſea, the deluge, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding vnder the Cloude; ſome the Lords ſupper, as the Manna given from

                  <p>The Sacraments of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are two; the one of entrance, to witte <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which ſucceeded <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 2.11.12. Act. 22.16 1 Pet. 13 21.</note>: the other of Nouriſhment, or food; namely, the <hi>Lords ſupper,</hi> which the Paſchall Lambe ſhadowed forth<note n="e" place="margin">Luc 21.15. 1. Cor. 5.8 1. Cor. 11.24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as all the cauſes doe moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently declare the verity of theſe two ſacraments: ſo they manifeſtly convince
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3172:166"/> the vanity of the reſt, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are wont to bee counterfeyted.</p>
                  <p>For of theſe two Sacraments, God is the Cauſe <hi>Efficient,</hi> by the worde of Inſtitution, that is, of commaundement, and promiſe: which Efficient Cauſe the other fiue ambiguouſly called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, haue not<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 28 19.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter,</hi> that is, the ſigne and the thing ſignified, is exhibited in theſe two Sacraments: the former whereof notwithſtanding, Penance hath not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but Matrimony, Order, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Extreame Vnction, haue it not by Divine Inſtitution: the latter of theſe, none of them hath moſt neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether you reſpect Chriſt himſelf, or his merite, or his benefites.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Forme</hi> of a Sacrament, is only found in Baptiſme, and the Supper: but the others haue indeede ſome ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but no ſealing, or preſenting at all.</p>
                  <p>The Principall, and Secondary end, theſe two Sacraments haue joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the other fiue eyther haue not,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3172:167"/> or haue it ſeverally, (or dividedly.)</p>
                  <p>To theſe are added two conditions annexed to the inſtitution of ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; whereof the firſt requireth, that a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ordinary, and perpetuall: the ſecond, that the vſe of a Sacrament, bee common to all, which profeſſe the ſame Covenant, and the ſame faith: which two conditions doe concur in Baptiſme, and the Supper: but in the others, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt of them is wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, as in the Extreame Vnction, which onely in the time of the Apoſtles, was as a Signe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not in ſickenes, paſt hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but likely to be recovered: or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is wanting; as in Matrimony, and Order; or both, as in Confirmation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sacraments of the old, and new Teſtament, in divers reſpects, doe both agree and differ.</p>
                  <p>They agree firſt in the <hi>Efficient,</hi> that is God, or the word of Inſtitution: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the<note n="g" place="margin">Genericis</note> 
                     <hi>Naturall parts,</hi> the Signe, and the thing ſignified. Thirdly, in the <hi>Relation,</hi> to the thing ſignified; which, in both places, is the ſame<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.3. 2. Cor. 5.</note>.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3172:167"/> Fourthly, in the <hi>End,</hi> to witte, that they bee viſible ſignes of Gods inviſibe grace.</p>
                  <p>But they differ, firſt in the <hi>outwarde Adiunctes,</hi> &amp; the circumſtance of time<note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 23 &amp; 5.6.</note>: Secondly, in the <hi>Manner of Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thirdly, in the <hi>Quality of the Signs.</hi> Fourthly, in the <hi>Number, Meaſure, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>Eaſineſſe:</hi> For ours are for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fewer, for profite better, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of heauenly things play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for vertue greater, and for action eaſier.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>First Place</hi> is of Mathew the 3. Anſw. There is no difference made between the Efficacy of Iohns Baptiſm, and Chriſts, but betweene the Perſons: whereof the one, by the outward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery onely giveth the water, as the Signe of the Remiſſion of ſinnes; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Inward Efficacy, giveth the Spirite, as the earneſt of the thinges ſignified. And hee vſeth the future Tenſe, ſpeaking of Chriſts Baptiſme,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3172:174"/> becauſe he hath reſpect to the very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Chriſts Preaching, which he was about to take in hand: neyther doth the Place cited out of Acts 19. proue the ſame power of both Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes: becauſe they are the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of them, who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Iohn, in the name of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Place,</hi> is of Marke the laſt, ver. 16. Anſw. It is there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not why, but who ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and withall, it is taught, what is the Conſequent of Baptiſme, and Faith.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> is of Iohn 3.5. Anſ. The name of Water is Equivocall. For in the Scripture, it is vſually taken in a three-fold ſignification: for, eyther ſpecially, it ſignifieth Baptiſme: or the the outward Legall waſhing; or laſtly, the very Effect of the holy Ghoſt in vs. If it bee taken in the firſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſenſe is, that Baptiſme is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Signe of Regeneration in the Church: If in the ſecond, the ſenſe is,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3172:175"/> that the outward clenſings of the Law doe not profite, vnleſſe the inwarde purging of the Spirite bee added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: If in the third, the Name of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is added<note n="d" place="margin">Exegetice</note>, by way of expoſition: for that the Efficacy of the outward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Baptiſme, dependeth vpon the Spirite.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth,</hi> is Act. 2. Anſwere. To be baptized for the Remiſſion of ſinnes properly noteth, not the Effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but the end, and ſcope thereof: neyther was the Action ordained to ſignifie the ſigne, but the ſigne to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the action ſignified.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fift,</hi> Act. 8. Anſwere. The Particle (By) ſignifieth ſometimes Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; ſometimes the Inſtrument, and ſometime the Signe. And in this place, it is taken Symbolically, becauſe the gift of the holy Ghoſt, by the laying on of hands, is both ſignified, and ſealed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sixt,</hi> is the 1. Cor. 10. Anſw. To partake of one Bread, is not a cauſe, but a publicke Teſtimony, that wee are of one Body, wherevpon it is called
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3172:175"/> one Bread, not in number, but by the common notion of a Sacrament; to wit, repreſenting vnto vs, that one myſticall body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seventh,</hi> is Eph. 1. Anſw. by a Metonymy, that, which is proper to the thing ſignified, is attributed to the ſigne: becauſe Baptiſme is the ſigne of our Conſecration; &amp; indeed effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, not by it owne power, but of him, who being one, became all things to vs, the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eight,</hi> is the 1. of Pet. Anſw. Salvation is attributed to Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the viſible Inſtrument of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, both by the ſignifying and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Adde further, that Baptiſme, as a Counter-paterne, is oppoſed againſt the deliverance, from the deluge, not in reſpect of Efficacy, but of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or the thing ſignified: Neyther is there a difference properly put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Baptiſme of the Iewes, and ours; but betweene the outward, and inward Baptiſme; for aſmuch as the Effect of this is Salvation, and Peace

After the <hi>firſt manner,</hi> Chriſt onely, by his holy ſpirit, ought to be called, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Author of Baptiſme, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as who firſt inſtituted Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in the perſon of Iohn the Baptiſt; whoſe Baptiſme Chriſt himſelfe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not to bee of men, but of God, and from heaven<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 1.23 31.</note>: and afterwardes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Baptiſme of Iohn inſtituted with the word of commaundement &amp; promiſe<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note>. For albeit, as touching the Circumſtance, and manner of Chriſts manifeſtation, there was ſome difference betweene the Baptiſme of Iohn, and of the Apoſtles, yet in kinde it was one, and the ſame Baptiſme, ſeeing that the definition, as of his Baptiſme, ſo alſo of theirs, is the ſame, and both agree in all the cauſes.</p>
                  <p>After the latter manner, the Miniſter is ſayde to be the Baptizer, or the cauſe vſing Baptiſme Inſtituted<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Heb 5.4.</note>: becauſe he adminiſtring Baptiſme in the name of Chriſt, doth Sacramentally, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3172:179"/> miniſterially, ſeale, and conferre the matter of Baptiſme: Now by the name of Miniſter wee vnderſtand him, to whome the Miniſtery of the word is committed in his lawfull calling: for theſe are Conjuncts.

                  <p>The <hi>Thing ſignified,</hi> is twofold: the one Generall, the other Particular: the one is already expounded in the doctrine concerning the Sacraments: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you reſpect the Eſſentiall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied things of baptiſme, may fitly bee referred to three heades.

                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:3172:180"/> we haue with Chriſt, wherby is wrought that wee are made partakers of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, merites and benefits<note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.13. Gal. 3.27</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter receyving Baptiſme,</hi> are they all, and alone, who probably are reckoned in the Covenant: now, there are reckoned both the ripe of age, who having made an entrance in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of faith, &amp; comming to the church, profeſſe their faith and repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, as alſo Infants, who, as they are partakers of the communion of the Covenant, by the forme and promiſe added therevnto<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note>, ſo are they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Communion of the ſigne, &amp; ſeale of the Covenant<note n="ſ" place="margin">Gen. 27.12.

                  <p>Adde further, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that as they are partakers of Gods promiſes in Chriſt, and his Church, ſo are they alſo of the Sacramentall ſignes, which were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for the ſealing of the promiſes<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 2.38 39.</note>. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that as by the power of the Spirite, they haue that wholy, which is ſignified, ſo it were wickedneſſe, that they ſhould bee excluded from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the ſignes<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that as the children of the faithfull ought to bee ingraffed into the Church, and to bee diſcerned from the vnfaithfull; ſo it were needefull, they ſhould be partakers of the ſinge of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and the note of differenee<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 2.39.</note>.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>But, becauſe of this Sacramentall agreement, and relation of the Signe, &amp; the thing it ſelfe, as alſo of the certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the receyving of the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3172:182"/> the names &amp; properties of the ſigne, and the thing ſignified are changed, by a familiar Metony my of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hence it is, that baptiſme is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſayde to bee in the Scripture, the <hi>Lavar of Regeneration,</hi> or the waſhing of the New birth; and<note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 3.56 1.

                     <hi>to ſaue vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Endes of Baptiſme</hi> are of two ſortes; for ſome are <hi>Principall,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent;</hi> ſome <hi>Secondary,</hi> and <hi>Conſequent:</hi> whereof, thoſe properly reſpect our Faith before God, but theſe our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before Men.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>firſt manner,</hi> the end of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is to ſignifie, ſeale, and exhibite Sacramentally, the Remiſſion of ſinnes, the benefite of Regeneration, and our vnion with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> for, albeit ſinne by reaſon of the ſtate of Nature abide, as touching the diſeaſe or roote of ſinne, and the very matter; yet it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, by reaſon of the ſtate of the perſon; as touching the guilt or forme, which is not imputed to the faithfull. Hence it is, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is ſayde <hi>to bee
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3172:182"/> given for the remiſſion of ſinnes</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 2.38 &amp; 22.26.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>benefite of Regeneration;</hi> becauſe we, being ingraffed into Chriſt by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, are changed into his nature, and are made partakers of his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for which cauſe, it is called the <hi>Laver of Regeneration</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Vnion with Chriſt;</hi> for, hence it is, that wee are ſayde to be <hi>Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Ga. 3.27</note>, <hi>and into the Name of Chriſt</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 28.19. 1. Cor. 12 13.</note>, by baptiſme, <hi>to be buried with Chriſt, and to be baptized into his death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 6.3.4.</note>.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Latter manner:</hi> the end of baptiſme is firſt, that it may bee a Teſtimony of our godlineſſe, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto God with Thankſgiving<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 4.1. Act. 2.41.</note>. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it may bee a badge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church, together with her members, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prophane Nations. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that it may bee the bond of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, and their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue, who are dipped in the ſame Lavar.</p>
                  <p>From this conſideration of the cauſes, two Conſequents are drawn:
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3172:183"/> the one, of the <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> the other, of the <hi>Effect, and Efficacy of Baptiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Neceſſity, two thinges doe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe, or limite, <hi>The Institution of God, and the Condition of him that is to be baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scope of <hi>Gods Inſtitution</hi> is, not to tie, eyther the things ſignified to the Signes, or the men to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by an abſolute neceſſity; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God by an immediate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary action when he will, and on whome he will, conferreth the thing ſignified: neyther can the ſimple want, but the contempt of the Sacrament be hurtfull, (which doth befall, neyther vnto all Infants, nor all them that are of ripe yeares:) but according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his will, it may ſeale the things ſignified in them who both can, and ſhould receyue the vſe of the ſignes.</p>
                  <p>They, that are to be <hi>baptized,</hi> are perſons of yeares, and Infants: to a perſon of <hi>yeares,</hi> Baptiſme is neceſſary vnto Salvation two wayes; eyther by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3172:183"/> 
                     <hi>Deſire, and Will,</hi> if liberty be not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to take the Layer of water: or really, and in <hi>very deed,</hi> if liberty bee granted. For faith hath alwayes joyned with it, the deſire of obedience. To an <hi>Infant,</hi> Baptiſme is neceſſary, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for the Inviſible, but after a ſort, for the viſible ingraffing of him into Chriſt, and the body of the Church; which if the point of neceſſity doe bar him from, that inviſibly is fulfilled with out baptiſme, which otherwiſe is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the viſible baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>The Effects of baptiſme are not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the doing away of all guilt, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmen; or the conferring of grace by the worke done; or laſtly, an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a marke, that cannot bee raced out; but they are the ſame with thoſe, which are the ends thereof aboue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. The <hi>Efficacy</hi> of all which Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is not aſcribed to the outwarde baptiſme, or the Elements of water, but to the bloud of Chriſt, and the inward baptiſme of the Spirit, which by a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den operation conferreth that inviſible
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:3172:184"/> Grace, which is ſignified in the outward Baptiſme.</p>

                  <p>The Second, is <hi>The breaking of the Bread, and the powring of the wine into the Cuppe,</hi> which Chriſt vſed, not onely for the cauſe of dividing, and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, but for the repreſenting of his death; for it is an Eſſentiall, and Sacramentall Ceremony of the Lordes Supper, pertayning to the end, &amp; forme

                  <p>To theſe Actions, (that wee may come to the ſecond part of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) Chriſt added <hi>Words;</hi> whereof ſome include a <hi>Commaundement,</hi> ſome a <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and laſtly, ſome an <hi>Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Theſe in Schooles haue vſually been

Thirdly, as there are two partes of man; the one, the body, the other, the ſoule; ſo there are two givings, and eatings; the one outward, which is called Sacramentall; the other

                  <p>Both expoſitions are wont two waies to be conſidered, eyther in each words apart, and by themſelues conſidered, or in the whole expoſition together.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Subject, is the Pronoune demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue, (this) not adjectiuely, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiuely taken: for it doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie<note n="h" place="margin">Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um vagum.</note> any ſingular thing: but the verie bread, which Chriſt Tooke, Brake, and Gaue to his Diſciples, and the Wine,

                  <p>The <hi>Attribute</hi> in the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> not the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which is the church, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the true, which for vs is given, and broken, and that as it was ſuch a body; In the ſecond, is <hi>the bloude of Chriſt,</hi> which for vs is ſhedde, and even that, as it was ſuch a bloud, according as the other member of theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which is pronounced by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallage of the preſent tenſe, for the future Tenſe, dooth moſt evidently proue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Copula,</hi> whereby the Attribute is knit with the Subject, is the Verbe Subſtantiue <hi>(IS,)</hi> which ought not, nor may bee taken Subſtantially; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by no meanes at all, the vnlike cannot properly, and Eſſentially be affirmed of his vnlike: but figuratiuely for a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Sacramentall Being, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the thing, which ſignifyeth,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:3172:197"/> taketh the name of that thing, which it ſignifyeth, becauſe of the Analogy of the one with the other: for by that litle word, Chriſt taught not what the bread and wine, were by nature, or ſubſtance; but what they were by ſignification, office, and vſe: for, by nature they are bread, and wine; by ſignification, they are the body, and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The whole Attribution, or Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not proper, or regular, whereas neyther the propoſition is Identicall; nor the body of Chriſt can properly be affirmed of the bread: to witte, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Body of Chriſt is, neyther the Generall, nor the Speciall, nor the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, nor the property, nor the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of bread, but it is <hi>Figuratiue, and Sacramentall.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> becauſe the exhibiting
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:3172:197"/> of the thing ſignified, is withall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and yet, there is no ſwerving from the word ſpoken or pronounced, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee retaine the word ſpoken, being Sacramentall, which is altogether diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from regular Predications, and to bee expounded with an interpretation, aunſwerable to the nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Expoſitiue</hi> wordes are theſe, by which Chriſt expounded, (or layde open) the end of this holy action; to witte<note n="l" place="margin">1.

                  <p>The <hi>Cauſe Efficient Adminiſtring,</hi>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:3172:198"/> or Inſtrumentall, are the Miniſters of the Church, called by lawfull ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by whome God, as by active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, offereth, and repreſenteth vs, thoſe things outwardly by the ſignes of breade and wine, which by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operation of the holy Ghoſt, hee effecteth in vs.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Inſtruments, if you reſpect the <hi>Office;</hi> it is to adminiſter the Lords Supper, with thoſe rites of diſpenſing them, in the very which, Chriſt went before by his owne example; If the Quality, ſo they lawfully execute their office in the preaching of the Word, &amp; the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, it nothing addeth to, or detracteth from the efficacy of a Sacrament: ſith the authoritie of Sacraments, if they bee conſidered in themſelues, dependeth not vpon the qualitie of the Miniſter, but vpon the Inſtitution, verity, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is two wayes vſually conſidered, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as that, which partaketh the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:3172:198"/> or as that, which conſtituteth the Supper, whereof, the one hath the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Subject, the other of the partes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Subiect,</hi> partaking the Supper, are all they, who, being by Baptiſme made the members of the Church, and now, being of yeares, profeſſe ſound doctrine, and haue the teſtimony of a holy life<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.20. &amp; 12.13.</note>.</p>
                  <p>From the circumſcription <hi>of this Subiect,</hi> are excluded firſt, the dead, or they that are departed this life; from whome, both the power of vſing the Sacrament is taken away, and vnto whome all the vſe thereof is in vaine, &amp; ineffectuall; as alſo the vſe of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, whereof the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are appendents. Secondly, the <hi>Sicke</hi> like to die: for Chriſt would haue this communion not to bee pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and domeſticall, but eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and publicke: neyther doth the want, but the contempt of the ſame hurt the partie that doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, though peradventure there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3172:199"/> reſpect to bee had concerning them that haue ſlipped, and that are <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> out of the church, and concerning priſoners, who are to bee puniſhed, and are now penitent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Children and Infants;</hi> for, to ſpeake properly, the Supper is meat, for the ſtronger, and the further grown in yeares, and not for Infants: neyther can they yeeld a reaſon of their Faith, nor examine themſelues; which, not withſtanding, how needefull it is, the Forme, &amp; End of the Lordes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo Tradition doe proue with great likely hood. Fourthly they, who for hereſie, or for their diſſolute life, are lawfully excommunicated: for this Supper requireth worthy gueſts, which liue to Chriſt in Spirit, &amp; Faith. Whence it was, that the perſons, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, or did Penance, after the Sermon ended, were in former time, commaunded to goe forth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> conſtituting the holy Supper, is two-fold; the one <hi>Earthly, Outward, Elementall, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſible;</hi> the other
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3172:199"/> 
                     <hi>Heavenly, Inward, and Spirituall;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is commonly called the <hi>Signe;</hi> this <hi>the thing ſignified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the name of <hi>Signe,</hi> all that is vnderſtoode, whatſoever is perceyved by the outward ſenſes, in the pure and lawfull adminiſtration of the Lordes Supper: whether it be the Element, or the bodily ſubſtance, or the action, or rite, agreeable to Gods inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Elementall Signes,</hi> (for of the Rites wee haue ſpoken in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Efficient Cauſe) are two, the <hi>Bread, and Wine:</hi> which two, albeit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially they are diſtinguiſhed, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and perfectlie, (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeake) they make but one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: now they ſo make it, that neyther more, nor fewer bee required, for the entireneſſe, and perfection of this Sacrament. <hi>Not more,</hi> becauſe all refreſhing, (or feeding) is by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and ours in Chriſt, is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted forth. Not <hi>Fewer,</hi> becauſe, if the one fayle (or be wanting) the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of perfect refection is taken
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3172:200"/> away.</p>
                  <p>And in this defect, Offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the maiming of the Elements, or in the communion vnder one kinde onely; againſt the <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles Tradition, The End and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Sacrament:</hi> and laſtly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Orthodoxall conſent of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church.</hi>

                  <p>From this two-fold vnion, a twofold manner of <hi>Communicating</hi> alſo ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                  <p>The one is <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> or Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, of the Signes, which is made by the taking of the bread and wine, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution &amp; ordinance of Chriſt, they are the holy ſignes of his body and bloud<note n="ſ" place="margin">1.

And this maner of eating is Temporall, and may bee iterated.</p>
                  <p>The other is <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; to witte, the very receyving of Chriſts body, and bloud in veritie, by the Spirite, by which Chriſt is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed vnto vs, that wee beeing made one with him, might by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite be quickned to life eternall<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 6.46 48.</note>, and ſo this ſpirituall communicating, doth not onely ſignifie Faith, but alſo appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is made by faith, &amp; our communion with Chriſt, whereupon, ſometimes it is called faith in Chriſt, ſometime the communion of Chriſtes benefites, and ſometimes our ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and incorporating into Chriſt.

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3172:225"/> Signes: for the Spirituall eating is to be diſtinguiſhed from the Sacramental, becauſe, that is internall, and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this externall, and viſible: and though it bee granted, that in that place, there is ſpeech made of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall eating; yet the foure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are from thence drawne, cannot proue that preſence. Not the <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the bread Synecdochical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is taken for meat, and the meat Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely, for the fleſh of Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the place cited, the bread is not the Subject, but the predicate of the fleſh. Not the <hi>Second,</hi> becauſe Chriſt by correcting, reproved, and by repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, corrected the Capernaits, and his Diſciples, as verſe 61.62.63. doe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew. Not the <hi>third,</hi> becauſe the wordes of eating, and drinking, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Figuratiuely, and as the Text decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they are of the ſame force, with theſe maners of ſpeaking, to belieue in Chriſt, and to abide in Chriſt.

                  <p>The <hi>Cauſe of Working,</hi> in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Church, is the good pleaſure of Gods will, whereby, from everla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſting, thee hath appointed to call forth ſome of Mankind, to the communion of his Grace<note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 1.5 Tit. 2.14.</note>. But the <hi>Worke</hi> it ſelfe, is the<note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>fulfilling,</hi> (or complement) of the church, which is to bee conſummated with thoſe degrees of meanes, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of times, wherewith it pleaſed God. Of which decree and worke, God
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3172:233"/> the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, is the common beginning; but the <hi>maner of Working is distinct.</hi> For the <hi>Father</hi> is the Efficient cauſe of the Church, of the <hi>Inviſible,</hi> by election, but of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſible</hi> by Creation. The <hi>Sonne</hi> is the Efficient cauſe of the <hi>Inviſible,</hi> by effectuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but of the <hi>viſible,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon offering of the ſame Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the preaching of the Goſpell: the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the Efficient cauſe, of the <hi>Inviſible,</hi> by ſaving ſanctification, and new creation in Chriſt; but of the <hi>viſible</hi> by outward calling, whereby hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more or leſſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is the manner of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, in the conſtituting of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now the cauſe efficient, neereſt, of the <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> and <hi>ordinance</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is Chriſt, God, and man, by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſpoſition, and diſpenſation of Grace, whereby God the Father, made and appointed Chriſt, the head over all, to his Church, which is his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<note n="o" place="margin">Rom 12 5. 1. Cor. 3.11.12. Col. 1.18.</note>.</p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:3172:233"/>
                  <p>And it is ſo, not by order of nature, but by the divine ordinance of ſaving Grace: for the Church is not ſayde to be a Phyſicall, and Mathematicall, but a myſticall body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore alſo, by the ſame bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of divine Ordination, Chriſt ought to bee helde, and eſteemed the head of his body, not many heades, but one, for the church is neyther without head, nor yet having many heades.</p>
                  <p>But, as the condition of the head over the body, doth chiefly conſiſt in three thinges in <hi>Order, Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;</hi> in <hi>Order</hi> towards the members, in <hi>Perfection</hi> in it ſelfe, in <hi>Power</hi> towardes the whole Body: ſo Chriſt alſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, perfection, and power, performeth all duties, after a moſt excellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which can or ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the beſt head.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Order,</hi> becauſe he, being true man, and true God, holdeth the chiefty in all things, having the ſupreminence, not onely of dignity, but alſo of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and power; whence it is, that
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3172:234"/> the Scripture doth very often affirme him to haue Beeing before all things, and to be placed aboue all things.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Perfection;</hi> becauſe Chriſt alone is the King, Prophet, and High Prieſt, having all things in himſelfe, from the Father, which any way may be required for the perfection of the head.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Power,</hi> and Efficacy; becauſe hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone inſpireth vigour, ſenſe, motion, and ſpirituall life into his members, and is alone knit faſt vnto the body, by the bond of the Spirit, yeelding that whole ioyning, and faſtening together of the members among themſelues, and with God, to the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cauſe of the Church</hi> Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and ſerviceable is, <hi>Generally,</hi> the word of God, what way ſoever revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and communicated, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or outwardly, or ioyntly both wayes<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 4.12.

                     <hi>Generally,</hi> the Forme of the church, is two wayes conſidered: <hi>Severally,</hi> in it ſelfe, and the Efficient cauſe thereof, or <hi>ioyntly</hi> in her Subject.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>former manner,</hi> the Forme of the church, is that divine, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calling wrought in heaven, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purpoſe of Gods will, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee decreede from everlaſting, the communion of himſelf with the church, and of the church, with himſelfe, in his beloved Sonne<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1.4.5.

                  <p>And of this calling, as the nature, as touching it ſelfe, is moſt perfect; ſo the manner of the ſame is alſo two-fold: the one immediate, the other mediate; that which God by himſelfe maketh through the vertue of his Spirite; this, which he maketh outwardly by ſpeech, ſigne, or working ordinarily, or extraordinarily, as it pleaſeth him to make it known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</p>

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:3172:239"/> of him that is called: by the one, God offereth, and conferreth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling; by the other, wee take holde of that, which is offered, and make anſwere to Gods calling: for it is needefull, that theſe two concurre together, that the calling bee effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; to witte, the calling of God by the vertue, and efficacy of his Spirite, and our correſpondent affection, or relation to that calling.</p>
                  <p>And according as one part of this Inviſible church doth warfare on earth; and the other triumphantly in heaven; ſo the manner of the forme hereof, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: for in the triumphant church, it is perfect in it owne kinde; but in the Militant, it is onely inchoatiuely, (or by way of beginning) tending to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by more or leſſe efficacy, acording to the meaſure of the ſpirit, &amp; faith. And hence it is, that in reſpect of this forme, the ſtate of the Inviſible church is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. For as it is vnited to Chriſt her head, it cannot erre, becauſe there is but one truth of the heade, the ſpirit, &amp;
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:3172:239"/> the body; but as it is conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it ſelfe, and the diverſe members thereof, it erreth in divers wayes and degrees<note n="k" place="margin">1.

                  <p>The Forme of the Church viſible: the one is <hi>(Conſtitutiue,)</hi> which orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Church: the other <hi>(Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,)</hi> that diſtinguiſheth the true church from the falſe.</p>
                  <p>The Forme which maketh the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, is that outward calling, which God mediately effecteth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that holy kinde of government, which hee would haue to bee kept in his houſe.</p>
                  <p>To this calling three thinges are as hand-maids; the word of the Goſpell, the vſe of the Sacramenrs, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:3172:240"/> communion of Saintes: for God calleth outwardly by Worde, Signe, and Worke, whereof wee haue more at large ſpoken in the place concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the calling of men vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>The Forme, that diſtinguiſheth, and maketh difference of the true Viſible Church, from the falſe, is that, which certaine markes doe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and point out.</p>
                  <p>Now wee call them Markes, by which the thinges, which come into queſtion, are certainely knowne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee to bee perceyved by ſenſe, or by vnderſtanding, or both wayes.</p>
                  <p>And as there is wont to bee of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing a double knowledge, the one which noteth out the Eſſence of the ſame, by the true and immediate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the other fette from the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and affections, declaring the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable diſpoſitions of the ſame, or the other outward accidents, which onely overcover the thing: ſo alſo, two ſortes of markes are agreeable to
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:3172:240"/> this double knowledge: for ſome are effectuall and neceſſary markes, which they call Signes infallible, and other ſome accidentall, which they tearme Probable: Theſe former, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tokens of the church, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſhew the Eſſence, and nature of the ſame, the latter are but common, and probable ſignes thereof.</p>
                  <p>The proper and eſſentiall note of the viſible church belonging to the Eſſence thereof, immediately and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and next of all flowing from the forme of the ſame, is onely one, to wit, the truth of Gods word revealed, and communicated, wherevnto the truth of the Sacramentes, as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably tyed or knit with it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 4.12.

                  <p>The accidentall markes are two-folde; for ſome are fet from thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſitions of the Church, which are inſeparable, which are alſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

                  <p>The <hi>Power Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> is three-fold; of <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and right in the church, to teach not every thing, but that onely, which the Lord hath preſcribed by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 1.8. 1. Tim. 6.3.</note>, and is the <hi>first part of the keies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> is an authoritie of the Church, which is imployed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about doctrine, and partly about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and lawes, for the outwarde policie of the Church: the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tearmed Doctrinall, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptiue;
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:3172:241"/> the other Conſtitutiue, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eccleſiasticall Diſcipline,</hi> is a judiciall power of the Church, whereby men receyved into the family of Chriſt, are directed to godlineſſe, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, leaſt they ſhould commit any thing vnbeſeeming their chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but the offenders are reproved, rebuked, and corrected: And this is the <hi>latter part of the keyes,</hi> diſtinct from the former; becauſe that, properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the office of <hi>teaching;</hi> but this, is moſt of all practiſed in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of mens offences, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of <hi>Eccleſiasticall Iudgements</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 16.19. Ioh. 19.23 Mat. 18.18. 1 Cor. 8.11.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And according as there are two ſorts of ſlippes to bee corrected, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning doctrine, and ſome others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning manners; ſo, about both theſe Eccleſiaſticall judgement is occupied, for the private good of the offender, and the publicke good of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three degrees of of that judgement: rebuking, conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with admoniſhment: Secondly, an
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:3172:242"/> Excluding, ſuſpending, or with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Lords Supper, whereby for a time the offender is forbidden, or barred from the participation of the Supper. Thirdly, Excommunication, whereby after a lawfull knowledge had before hand, ſome perſon for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious contumacy, is excluded from the communion of Saintes, or as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, is delivered vppe to Sathan, to the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirite might be ſaved<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 18 18. 1. Cor 5.4 &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The publicke exerciſes of godlines, and charity, which notifie the true Church<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 2.42 1 Tim. 2.1 1. Cor. 1.2.</note>; are a gathering for the poore, the Miniſtery, the receyving of the word, and ſacrament, Prayer<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 13.35.</note>, ſinging of Pſalms; &amp;c. but the private, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede make for the ordering of our life, are the exerciſes of repentance: and thoſe, which reſpect our neighbour, are the exerciſes of charity, as Almes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And of all thoſe markes, there is a common vſe, &amp; outward ſhew of them, for the moſt part in all Churches: but
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:3172:242"/> the right of poſſeſſion, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of them is proper, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the true Church onely.</p>
                  <p>Whence, judgement ought to bee given concerning the purity, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, the cleaneneſſe, or obſcurity of the viſible Church. For that church, which hath that Eſſentiall marke, and all thoſe, which are accidentall, is the pureſt; that, which hath that onely, and not all theſe, is the true Church, but imperfect: that, which hath ſome of theſe, and not that, is the Church, ambiguouſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or that, which is Hypocriticall; that, which hath neyther theſe, nor that, is not a Church at all.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe the particular Church, which hath theſe markes, eyther hath them perfectly, or according to parts, and againe both wayes, according to the quantity, and quality diverſly, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſſe, eyther more purely, or more vnpurely: Hence it commeth to paſſe, that particular Churches both diverſly erre, and oftentimes fayle: they
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:3172:243"/> erre more or leſſe, according as they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleaue to the truth, or ſwerue from the ſame<note n="x" place="margin">1. Cor. 13.9.

                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> of the Church in generall, is the glory of God himſelfe, or the prayſe of the glory of his grace: but in Particular, (the end) of the Inviſible Church, is the ſalvation of the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and of the viſible, the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; fulfilling of the body of Chriſt, out of them that were generally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Integrity,</hi> or the firſt creation of man before his Fall, is a ſingular worke of God in Nature, whereby hee made man a Reaſonable creature, being of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound (or double) nature, according to his Image, for his owne glory, and the good of Man himſelfe,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> is <hi>Iehovah Elohim,</hi> The Lord God, or God in the Plurality of Perſons, and Vnity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:3172:258"/> for there is but one finiſhing, (or perfecting) of the worke of one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; though according to the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the perſons, the order of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is diſtinct: For the Father created by the Sonne, through meanes of the power of the Spirite himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now God effected it both by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſultation, will, and conſent going before<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.27.</note>, and by a manner of of effecting or creating, partly imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, if you reſpect the ſoule, which God of nothing created, by infuſing, and infuſed by creating<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1.7</note>; partly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, if you reſpect the body, which was brought forth from a matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent.</p>

                     <hi>The Matter</hi> or Subject of this firſt eſtate is humane nature endued with all perfections, which in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues might befitte, for a thing created, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas wee call it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wee vnderſtand not onely that, which is incorporeall, or the corporeal onely, but that which is compoſed,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:3172:259"/> and as it were tempered of both: for there are two eſſentiall partes of this Subject, or humane nature, whereof wee treate, the Body, and the Soule: the truth whereof ought to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and diſtinguiſhed by their firſt <hi>Beginning, Substance,</hi> and <hi>Qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By their firſt beginning: becauſe the bodies of our firſt Parents were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a matter preexiſtent, or having a fore-being; eyther neere, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Eue,</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ribbe, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2.7 22. 1.

Elements, &amp; which Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chically, are vnderſtoode by the name of earth, as being an Element for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and quantity predominant: but the ſoules were created of nothing, by the vertue of Gods infinite power, as after the ſame manner, God createth new ſoules in every body; for they are not brought forth from the body<note n="d" place="margin">Per tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducem.</note> by derivation, but are brought into the body by creation<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 33.14. Zach. 12.1 Heb. 12.9.</note>; nor are they forced out by the power of the matter, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living creatures, as well perfect,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:3172:259"/> as imperfect: for they are ſimple ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, which are neyther divided, nor changed, nor corrupted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Subſtance,</hi> becauſe the bodies are compound ſubſtances, furniſhed with diverſe Organes (or Inſtruments) by which the ſoules exerciſe their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and faculties: but the ſoules are ſubſtances, both ſimple and immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for being compared to other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall thinges, they conſiſt of no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that they haue not any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matter, their beginning and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hath taught: as alſo immortall, not abſolutely by themſelues by the Law of nature, or compoſition: for God alone, being life it ſelfe, is by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe immortall: but by the grace of God the creator, and his divine will, which created the ſame to be ſuch, that though it had a beginning, yet it ſhould not haue an end<note n="f" place="margin">1.

                  <p>By <hi>Qualities;</hi> becauſe even their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had alſo an incorruptibility, not in their owne nature abſolutely; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rything compoſed of contraries, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:3172:260"/> but by Gods grace, whereby man was able, as touching his body, not to die, vnleſſe through his<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3.19.

For the vnderſtanding apprehendeth Being, and Truth: the vniverſall, indeede by it ſelfe; but the particular by ſenſe. The <hi>Will</hi> inclineth forward to good, which, becauſe it is in the things them ſelues, it doth not properly draw, and take vnto it the very things, but is drawne of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Forme</hi> of this firſt Eſtate of man is limitted in the condition, and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:3172:260"/> conſideration of the Image of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which man was created.</p>
                  <p>Now we call the <hi>Image</hi> of God, that likeneſſe, whereby man reſembleth the nature of his Creator after a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner of his nature, partly in the ſoule properly, partly in the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Soule; Laſt of all, partly in the whole, and entire perſon, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vnion of both.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Soule:</hi> whether you reſpect the <hi>Nature</hi> thereof, and the faculty of ſubſtance, or the <hi>Faculties;</hi> or laſtly, the <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>habites,</hi> wherby they are perfected.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soule,</hi> which reſemble the nature of God, are chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly two; <hi>

                  <p>Both as well the facultie of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the liberty of will, is two-fold: the <hi>Facultie of vnderſtanding,</hi> the one is <hi>Paſſible,</hi> (or ſuffering,) as mans mind is of it owne nature capable of all things: the other Actiue, (or doing,) which effecteth that thoſe things, which in power may bee vnderſtoode, by Act bee vnderſtoode. <hi>Liberty</hi> (or freedome) the one is from <hi>compulſion;</hi> becauſe man is not compelled to that, which is ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge from a Free-will; the other, from <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,</hi> becauſe he is not violently
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:3172:261"/> letted (or hindered) from that, which he ſeeketh after with a free will<note n="p" place="margin">1. Co. 7.37. Rom. 8.7 Rom. 8.2 1</note>.

                  <p>The <hi>Habites,</hi> which performe thoſe faculties, are two. For wiſedome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the vnderſtanding; but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, the will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſedome</hi> is an excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge, both of the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall good, whereby he knoweth God, and his felicity in God; and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, whereby he knoweth the things created, and their natures<note n="q" place="margin">Col 3 10.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> is that vprightneſſe of the mind, whereby perfectly, that is, inwardly, and outwardly, it obeyed Gods will, according to the whole law; which righteouſneſſe was not onely of perſon, but of nature, becauſe the firſt man was created in it, and vnto it, as the originall and roote of mankind, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of Originall ſinne, ought to bee conſidered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by three wayes, and degrees: for there is a double outward cauſe, &amp; one inward.</p>
                  <p>The outward neereſt cauſe, is the actuall ſinne of Adam, who was as the mediate and common beginning of whole humane nature<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5 12.19.</note>: but the <hi>Remote</hi> was the juſtice of God, which God had ſhadowed in nature, and expreſſed in ſpeech plainely vttered, (or in the word Enunciatiue<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>.) The inward Cauſe, is the very Law of Nature, originally paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; of which law, God layed downe a double ordinance. By the one hee commaunded a propagation abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by the other hee threatened a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:3172:267"/> conditionally, with the former, he furniſhed both man, &amp; in man Nature; with the latter, man only. Hence it came to paſſe, that, by that ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, man is begotten; but by the ordinance of puniſhment, hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vitious<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.16. Heb. 7 9.10. 1. Cor. 15.22.</note>. Both alike neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of Actuall ſin, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, &amp; immediately is the wil, which commaundeth the Act, in which the whole Action of evill reſideth, as in the Agent (or working) Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 6.5 Iac. 1.14.15.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Matter of Adams firſt ſinne, which is as the Subject, is the whole, and entire perſon of Adam, and in him, as in the actiue beginning, the whole matter of mankind<note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 15 22</note>. But that, which is of the Object, is the taking of the forbidden fruite, and the vſe or eating thereof<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 3.4.5.</note>; both whereof includeth a contempt of Gods commaundement, an impious conſent of licentious will, Briefly, a moſt miſerable backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from God, and a diſobedience

                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of Actuall ſin, which is as the Subject, is man, according to

                  <p>Hence alſo is the difference between ſinne pardonable, and vnpardonable; whereof the one is ſayed to be a ſinne, which is committed againſt the father, and the Sonne; that is every tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods law, wherevnto Repentance belongeth, and therefore that, which is pardonable, not by the properties of it own nature, but by the grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of him, againſt whome it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 12.31.</note>: the other is ſayd to be a ſinne
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:3172:269"/> which is committed againſt the holy Ghoſt, and therefore is called by an excellency in Scriptures, the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie of the Spirite, and a ſinne vnto death<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 12 31. 1. Ioh. 5.16.</note>. Now, for the making of this Sinne, three thinges concurre. Firſt, the <hi>Deniall</hi> of the Truth againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſcience: Secondly, an vniverſall <hi>Backe-ſliding</hi> from Chriſt, &amp; not a particular ſinne againſt the firſt or ſecond Table of the Law. Thirdly, a <hi>Rebellion</hi> ſprung from a hatred of the truth, conjoyned with a tyrannicall, ſophiſticall, and hypocritical oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (or withſtanding:) and of theſe conditions, there is a mutuall knitting and ſequele of the one with, and after the other. Further, it is called a <hi>Sinne against the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> not in reſpect of the divine Eſſence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirite, but in reſpect of his office, that is of Grace, and illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof the holy Ghoſt is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Worker (or effecter:) but it is ſayed to be vnpardonable for three cauſes: Firſt, becauſe of the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:3172:269"/> of God, who ſuffereth not his Spirite, which is the Spirite of truth, to bee reproved of a lie. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of impenitency, or the hardnes to repent. Thirdly, becauſe of the truth and the dignity of redemption, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt. For there remaineth no other ſacrifice after men haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſacrifice of Chriſt<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 6.4. Heb. 10.20</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Formall</hi> of Adams firſt ſinne, is two-fold, according as that ſinne in a divers reſpect, is eyther a <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>Relation:</hi> as it is equality, the formall thereof is diſobedience<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 5.19. Rom. 5.14.15. 1. Tim. 2.13.</note>: as it is a Relation.

                  <p>The Formall of <hi>Originall Sinne,</hi> is likewiſe vſually taken two wayes, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for guilt, which nevertheleſſe, is rather the neceſſary conſequent of that ſinne, or the proper accident thereof; or for that whole deformity of whole nature, which was not infuſed, nor yet
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:3172:270"/> gotten by imitation, but naturall, or (as wee ſpeake) connaturall, (or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together) with vs, not by the vice of common Nature, but by the vice of the firſt originall Inſtrument; from which all deſcended naturally<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 52.7 Rom. 5.12 1.

                  <p>The <hi>Formall</hi> of actuall ſinne, is an inordinatene adioyned to that, which is ſpoken, done, and luſted after againſt the Law; which ought to be diſcerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the actions &amp; motiues, as the defect, from the effect.

                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> of the firſt Originall, and Actuall Sinne, ought to bee diſcerned after one, and the ſelfe ſame manner, and conſideration. Now it is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two wayes; Firſt by the Accident,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:3172:270"/> in reſpect of God diſpoſing ſinne to the iuſt end, and moſt wiſely ſhewing forth his glory, both by workes of juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who endeavour to ſinne, &amp; by workes of mercy towardes them, whome he freeth from ſinne for Chriſt: Secondly, according to it ſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of man, in whome ſinne is: in which reſpect, an end of Sinne cannot properly bee granted: but in ſteade thereof are granted two Conſequents, or effects, guilt &amp; puniſhment<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2 17.

The puniſhment is both deathes, both of the body temporall, and of the ſoule together with the body eternall. Wherevnto are conjoyned afflictions, as the fore-goers of both, and theſe, through the goodneſſe of God, are in thoſe, which are truely faithfull, eyther tryals, or martyredomes, or fatherly
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:3172:271"/> chaſtiſements, but in the wicked, they are in theyr owne nature, torments &amp; puniſhments: and theſe two Effects do altogether hold all men bound, being conſidered in the ſtate of nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference of age; yea, the very Infants, who both haue a guilt, and feele a moſt bitter puniſhment, both of loſſe, and ſence, vnleſſe God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avert it.

                  <p>The <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of this Free-will, is vſually two wayes diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

                  <p>The <hi>Forme</hi> of Free-will, is the very freedome of the mind, or of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue will, which (for learning ſake) muſt three wayes be diſtinguiſhed, &amp; known. For there is one freedome in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, another to the Object, and laſtly another from the lett that croſſeth the ſame: which three it is needefull that wee know, for the making of this Forme, and for the condition of mans Free-will.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is required <hi>freedome in the Subiect,</hi> that is, in the will it ſelfe, which from her inward beginning, worketh alwayes freely, and that by reaſon of it owne nature, according to which a free neceſſity of willing is laide vpon it. So that it is not to bee called a Will which is bereft of this Freedome. For the wil hath ſuch a reciprocacy with Freedome, as with it owne Eſſentiall property.</p>
                  <p>Then there is required <hi>freedome to the Obiect,</hi> eyther to both, oppoſite by way of diſjunction, to witte, eyther mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:3172:280"/> good, or morall evill, whereof the one is choſen, or refuſed before (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then) the other, or to eyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when onely one is offered to be taken, or refuſed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is required <hi>freedome from the let that croſſeth.</hi> For the wil of man is freede from compulſion and from neceſſity. From Compulſion; for what it doth, it doth the ſame of it owne accord. From Neceſſity; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in reſpect of the Speciall, it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily limited to doe eyther good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or evill onely, or both; yet by it own inward power, it freely limiteth it ſelfe to the bringing forth of it owne act; yet it is needefull, that both manners of Freedome be diſtinguiſhed. Firſt, from the Freedome of right, and ſecondly from the Freedome of ſlavery: That na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath denied to man: This, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature. He hath not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of right, who of due is Subject to another, and according to the will of the ſame, liueth, is moved, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 21.1 Act. 2.23.</note>: Wherefore all ſelfe power, or
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:3172:281"/> liberty ought to bee given and aſſigned to God alone: he hath not freedome from ſlavery, who through his owne fault, hath made himſelfe a ſlaue to ſinne, and the tyranny thereof<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 8.34.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> is the glory of God in his Iuſtice, and mercy, and the Salvation, or inexcuſableneſſe of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Particularly,</hi> in the ſtate of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Free will is defined to be, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculty, and power, freely, and without coaction, to chuſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the evill, which by the mind is offered to the will, to be choſen and performed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Efficient Primarie Cauſe</hi> is God, both in reſpect of the Will, and the freedome it ſelfe, as being the Author, and beginning of both, as touching the naturall ſtate thereof. The neereſt cauſe are the mind, and will of man ſo farre forth, as both by corruption of nature are averted from good, and converted to evill; and the vnderſtanding verily propoſeth and iudgeth falſhood for truth; and the
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:3172:281"/> will chuſeth, and followeth the evill in ſtead of the good<note n="c" place="margin">Tit 1.15 1 Cor. 2.14. Rom. 8.7. Rom. 5.6. 2. Tim. 2.26.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> as it is conſidered in the Subiect, is the naturall, or carnal man, but as in the obiect, it is the evill, vnto which the actions of both faculties are carried.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Evill, whether you referre it to the inward, or to the outwarde actions, wee two wayes conſider: ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and in it ſelfe; or Relatiuely, as having reference to another thing. The Evill abſolutely is that, which is ſtrictly forbidden of God. Relatiuely, is that, which is evill in the obiect, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and end; that is, which eyther is not truely good, or is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto thoſe thinges, which are not truely good.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe when there is mention made of good; eyther the naturall, and morall good, as touching man; or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, divine good, according to grace, is vnderſtoode: Wee muſt here obſerue a very great difference, when there is ſpeech of Free-will. For the power of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:3172:282"/> a naturall man, if it be referred to the thing, which this naturall light reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, hath indeed her inclinations to naturall good, and morall good, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching man<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 1 19.20. Rom. 2.15 Rom. 2.14</note>; but becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of every good, proceedeth from iudgement, and iudgement from the choice, and choyce from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the power of man is limitted to the good, according to the meaſure of the knowledge of that good in man. Now that knowledge is not true, becaus it erreth in the maner of the truth, and ſtrayeth from the true end and ſcope thereof<note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 2 14. Ier. 13.23 Mat. 12.35. Ro. 14.23.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Now the morall good, according to grace, which is ſupernaturall, is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but by a ſupernatural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is not in the natural man: &amp; therfore man being vnder ſinne, hath neyther inclinations, nor motions to that good: for he wanteth all power to ſupernaturall things, even that power, which the Philoſophers haue called the receptiue, or paſſiue power, becauſe every power is from a beginning, but

                  <p>The Efficient Cauſe of faith is two wayes vſually expounded, <hi>Primary,</hi> or <hi>Inſtrumentally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Primarie Cauſe of Faith, is God, who had his fore-going good pleaſure, and the onely free affection of his will, no preparation of our righteouſnes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, or merite of our workes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the ſame<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 6.29 Eph. 2.8 Luc. 24.32</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Inſtrumentall Cauſe</hi> of Faith, is two-folde; the one inward and chiefe, the other outward and furthering.</p>
                  <p>The inward chiefe Cauſe is the holy Ghoſt, who begetteth the ſame in the Elect, by a ſpeciall action, next, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, beyond the order of nature, partly, by diſpoſing the vnderſtanding to the ſaving knowledge, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt; partly, by induing the
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:3172:290"/> will with new qualities, and by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, that it might particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and firmely aſſent, and cleaue to that knowledge, and receyving<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.9. 2. Cor. 4.6 Gal. 5.22.</note>. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and furthering Cauſe is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, by which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ordinarily formeth, &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this very worke of Faith in vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God, according to the Liberty of his power, and will, may beget, &amp; worke faith without the vſe of this ordinary meanes, when it pleaſeth him, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 1 7.16.17. Rom. 10.8 Ioh. 3.8.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Matter of Faith ought onely three, wayes diſtinctly to be conſidered, acording as it hath reſpect vnto the Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject, Object, or parts.</p>
                  <p>The Subiect proper, and neereſt, is the vnderſtanding, and will of man, as both theſe faculties are regenerate by the ſupernatural grace and vertue of the Spirite, and as the vnderſtanding know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſupernaturall benefits of faith, which are offered in Chriſt as true, and the will applyeth the ſame to it ſelf, with a ſure perſwaſion of the heart, as good &amp; healthfull<note n="i" place="margin">Luc. 24.25.

                  <p>The <hi>Obiect</hi> in reſpect of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is Gods truth, in reſpect of the will, is Gods ſingular Grace, laid open by his promiſes in Chriſt Ieſus. Now both are contained and limitted in the word of God, which wholy and ſoly faith imbraceth, as her levell object, &amp; in the ſame Chriſt crucified, together with all his benefites, as her principall, firſt, neereſt, and proper Object<note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.2. Heb 10.22 2. Cor. 3.4 Rom. 4.8. &amp; 8.38.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Parts,</hi> according to the maner of the Subject, or Object, are wont di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly to be conſidered. In reſpect of the divine vnderſtanding, and will, they are both a Knowledge, &amp; an Aſſent: the Knowledge is, wherby we vnderſtand the whole word of God, as touching the principall heades thereof, according to the meaſure of grace revealed<note n="l" place="margin">Eſa. 53.11.

Eph. 3.12. Eph. 1.22</note>.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the will, the chiefe and principall part of faith, is, Truſt
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:3172:291"/> which is a firm perſwaſion of the heart; whereby every one of them, that are truely faithfull, do particularly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to themſelues, the generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace. Which truſt manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe by a double effect, to wit, by conſtant Indurance, whereby faith oppoſeth it ſelfe to all dangers, inward and outward; and ful Perſuaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſurely truſt in God concerning our ſalvation<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8 15.16.

Firſt, the Apoſtles definition of Faith, and the ſence, and interpretation of the two properties of faith, whereof mention is made in that Definition. For faith is ſayde to be a Ground (or ſubſtance,) not that it is a naked repreſentation made in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but for that it is a certaine and vndoubted aſſurance of the will, as it may eaſily bee collected by the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces compared, the one with the other, Pſal. 39.8. Heb. 3.14. Againe, Faith is called an <hi>Evidence,</hi> becauſe it affordeth that certainety of demonſtration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely the mind, but alſo the will is convinced, that it might, particularly apply vnto it ſelfe Gods promiſes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the mind.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that, which is alleadged concerning the vnderſtanding of the Creation, by faith; for beſides that, there is an other reſpect of Faith iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, which properly hath an eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:3172:294"/> to the benefite of Redemption, and not vnto the worke of Creation; we muſt alſo note, that ſome thinges are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of faith in Scriptures, rather in reſpect of knowledge, or aſſent, and ſome things rather in regard of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (or aſſurance,) neyther doth the vnderſtanding exclude aſſurance, but goeth before it. Thirdly, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Noah; for the Act of his faith doth not onely reſpect the deluge, and the truth of Gods judgement; but alſo the ſaving of himſelfe from the deluge; which hee could not beleeue, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, but by the Aſſurance of the wil. Fourthly, that, which is alleadged, concerning the things, belonging to God; becauſe that ſame faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle treateth, doth withall ſuppoſe both knowledge in reſpect of the Eſſence and Nature of God, &amp; confidence of his gratious rewarding.</p>

                  <p>Now it is needefull that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of good workes bee expounded two wayes: firſt, according to their owne common nature, and reſpect; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, according to the chiefe kind of a Chriſtian life, and the principall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of a Chriſtian man in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good Workes,</hi> according to their own
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:3172:297"/> common nature, and reſpect, which of vs in this place, are indeede conſidered Theologically, and not eyther Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically, or Politically, are defined to be, <hi>Actions,</hi> which are done (the holy Ghoſt working the ſame,) of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, by faith, according to Gods law, to the glory of God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of faith, and our election, and the aedification of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>The Efficient Cauſe of good works is vſually conſidered, eyther as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, or Secondary. The Principall is God the Father in his Sonne, by the holy Ghoſt, from whome, in whom, and by whom, is the beginning, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, as in nature, ſo aboue nature<note n="a" place="margin">Phi. 2.13 1. Cor. 4.7 Ioh. 3.27. &amp; 15.5. Eph. 2.4</note>. Now, God effecteth good workes, partly in reſpect of the age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is man regenerate, whom hee prepareth, informeth, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth after a ſaving and ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Grace of ſanctification, that hee might both be willing, and able to worke well: partly in reſpect of the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:3172:297"/> action, which hee ſanct fieth, that it might bee good both in the generall, and in the ſpeciall, and in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Efficient Cauſe is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Externall, or Internall, both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, in reſpect of that former, (or ſuperiour) Cauſe. The Externall is man regenerate, Immediately produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing good actions, according to the meaſure, and degree of his Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, becauſe the Spirite and the fleſh are mixed one with an other in a man regenerate, it commeth to paſſe, that in one, and the ſame worke, the action ſpringeth mixed of both, by a mutuall conflict, which by the more intentiue quality is vſually named the worke of the Spirite, or of the<note n="b" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.8. Rom. 7 23 Eph. 2.3</note> fleſh, Whence is the infection, and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even of the beſt workes. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall is Faith, not by the vertue, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, or efficiency of it ſelfe; but as it apprehendeth that her object inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, vnto which it is carried, to witt, Chriſt, in reſpect of whome onely the
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:3172:298"/> holy Ghoſt worketh in vs both to will, and to doe good, and our actions, though moſt vnperfect, doe neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, pleaſe God, and are approved of him.</p>
                  <p>The Matter of good works, is whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is preſcribed by the Law of God: for both God alone hath the authority of commaunding, and the Law of God alone, hath the rule and manner of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commandement, which hath reſpect vnto that, which is right and good<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 15.22. Ezek. 20.19. Mat. 15.9. Eſa. 29.23.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Of this Matter, according to the diſtinction of Gods Law into two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, there are two chiefe and principall parts: the former whereof preſcribeth, and commaundeth the duty of man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; God or godlines: the latter, the duety of man towards man; or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                  <p>The good works, which belong to godlineſſe, are abſolutely, and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and cannot be otherwiſe: the conſideration whereof is moſt perfectly ſet downe in the fowre precepts of the firſt Table. For the works of godlines do
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:3172:298"/> properly belong, eyther to the inward diſpoſition of the mind, namely, that we ſhould hold both the truth of Gods worſhip which is expreſſed in the firſt precept, &amp; the maner of that truth which is expreſſed in the ſecond: or they doe belong to the outward teſtifying of the body, to wit, that both in words, which is in the Third, and in works, which is in the Fourth, we ſhould giue our ſelues to all exerciſes of godlines.</p>
                  <p>The good works, which belong to humanity, are moſt perfectly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſix precepts of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for firſt the foundation of them all is laid in the firſt precept, to wit, that mutuall relation of obedience, &amp; duety of the inferiors towards the ſuperiours, and the ſuperiors towards the inferiors: then the chiefe, and ſpeciall kinds of humanity are reckoned vp, vnto which, all the reſt muſt proportionally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. The ſumme of theſe is, not to hurt our neighbour, neyther in deede, nor word, nor thought: not in Deed, eyther in reſpect of his perſon, that hee
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:3172:299"/> muſt not kill, or in reſpect of his goods, that he muſt not ſteale, or in reſpect of the Perſon, which doth moſt neerely belong vnto him, that he muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery.</p>
                  <p>Not in Word, for he muſt beare no falſe witneſſe againſt him. Laſtly, not in mind, and thought: for very luſt &amp; concupiſcence is forbidden.</p>
                  <p>The Forme of good workes is a full perfect conformity in all the partes thereof, with the Law of God, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward ſhew, and the inward truth;<note n="c" place="margin">1 Deut. 27.26. Gal 3.10. Rom. 7.14</note> for two thinges concur for the making of this Forme, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goodneſſe of the workes, which the precepts of the Law doe outwardly ſhew and require, and the inward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the ſame, which the nature of the Law, which is ſpirituall, and of the Law-giver, who being a ſpirit, and a knower of the heart, according to their manner, doe declare, neceſſarily preſuppoſe and require.</p>
                  <p>And in reſpect of this double form, the manner of good workes, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:3172:299"/> themſelues is moſt perfect, but as touching vs, moſt imperfect: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe, of the reliques of ſinne; partly, becauſe of the continuall fight and wraſtling of the old and new man in vs, &amp; partly alſo becauſe of the ſtate, degrees, and increaſings of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore if there be ſaid to be any perfection of workes, while we are here, That is ſpoken abuſiuely, eyther for the merite of Chriſt, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of God, or by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto thoſe, who haue not as yet ſo proceeded in the <hi>Study,</hi> or <hi>exerciſe</hi> of godlineſſe, and workes; Or laſtly, after a humane manner according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſcipline. There is therefore no merite of good workes, ſith there is no proportion of equality betweene the reward, and the workes, ſith alſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever works are granted for good, are from another, are due, and are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7 23. 2 Cor. 3.5 Phil. 2.23.
